<H3>Background on the source of the nuclear weapons graphics:</H3>

<P>Many of the US shots were purchased from the LLNL public relations people. 
 
<P>Nearly all of the UK shots are from the Australian Dept. of Primary Industries & Energy, although their originator is the AWE (Atomic Weapons Establishment), UK. 
 
<P>The French shots are from the C.E.A., France.

<P>Those not obtained directly from the above sources were scanned from various publications, the images themselves are believed not to be under copyright.
 
<P>Nearly all of them were taken by government photographers, except one or two which are noted.
 
<P>They are all believed to be in the public domain. I claim no copyrights, or other rights, to any of them.
 <P>
