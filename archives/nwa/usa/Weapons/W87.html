<TR><TD colspan=3>This schematic of the W-87 is from the <i>Cox Committee Report</i> (the Report of the Select<br>Committee on U.S. NationalSecurity and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's<br>Republic of China). Its accuracy is debatable but the features depicted make sense, and this<br>diagram prompted former weapon physicist Sam Cohen to remark:
<blockquote>... But what should be at least as disturbing is that the Cox report presents a beautiful<br>multicolored diagram (see graphic) that details the workings<br>and components of this highly classified warhead. That is, the Cox<br>report provides an extremely useful
blueprint for use by Pakistan or India.</blockquote><br><i>Insight Magazine</i>, 16 July 1999

<P>The W87 warhead belongs to the newest missile warhead family, sharing a design similar to the W88. It was designed for use on the Peacekeeper (MX) ICBM. It combines a relatively high yield with increased accuracy to make it an effective hard target kill weapon. It is hardened against nuclear effects, and has enhanced safety features.</P>

<h2>Design Features</h2>
<p></p>
<p><h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two stage radiation implosion weapon;</li>
<li>U-238 lined radiation case;</li>
<li>Plastic foam filled radiation channel;</li>
<li>RV CEP (circle error probability) is <400 feet</li>
<li>The warhead yield can be upgraded from 300 Kt to 475 Kt by adding rings or a sleeve of oralloy (highly enriched uranium) to the second stage. This probably entails replacing depleted uranium rings used in a cylindrical fusion tamper so that less energetic neutrons can produce additional fission.</li>
<li><P>Warhead is more efficient in its use of special nuclear materials than the similar yield W-78. This may refer in part to substituting depleted uranium for U-235 in the secondary.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><h3>Primary Stage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two-point initiated (two detonator) firing system;</li>
<li>Uses LX-17 and PBX-9502 insensitive high explosives (IHEs)  - a TATB plastic bonded explosive composition. An ultra-fine grain TATB booster is used to fire the main charge.</li>
<li>Beryllium reflector;</li>
<li>Fissile plutonium core in the form of a hollow ellipsoidal thin shell;</li>
<li>Deuterium-tritium gas boosted</li>
</ul></p>

<p><h3>Secondary Stage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spherical thermonuclear secondary;</li>
<li>Contains oralloy (highly enriched uranium U-235) as a thermonuclear spark plug;</li>
<li>U-238 fusion pusher/tamper;</li>
<li>U-235 as an optional secondary tamper material to boost yield;</li>
<li>Lithium-6 (95% enrichment) deuteride fusion fuel</li>
</ul></p>


<p><h3>Mk-21 RV:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alumium substructure, sheathed in graphite-epoxy composite;</li>
<li>Carbon fiber fabric nose;</li>
<li>Carbon fiber-phenolic resin heatshield</li>
</ul></P>

<H3>Delivery Method</H3>
<P>Peacekeeper (MX) ICBM (LGM-118A). Each missile carries 10 W-87s, and is based in a hardened underground silo. As the Peacekeeper is retired under the provisions of START-II, these warheads will be used either to rearm Minuteman III missiles as single warhead missiles, or to equip Trident II D5 SLBMs.</P>

<H3>Safeguards and Arming Features</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Mechanical arm/safe device (MSAD) used in primary
<LI>Enhanced fire safety through use of:<UL>
	<LI> IHE</LI>
	<LI>refractory insulation surrounding the primary;</LI>
	<LI>fire resistant pit (sealed beryllium refelctor shell capable of withstanding 1000 degrees C for several hours);</LI></UL></UL>
<P>See <a href="Pal.html">Principles of Nuclear Weapons Security and Safety</a> for explanations of these features.

<h3>Fuzing and Delivery Mode</h3>
<P>Primary fuze is inertial (i.e. dead reckoning using guidance information)<BR>
Secondary dual mode S-band radar fuze (4 antennas) for airburst and surface/proximity fuzing<BR>
Fuzing options:<UL>
<LI>High altitude airburst </LI>
<LI>Medium altitude airburst </LI>
<LI>Low altitude airburst </LI>
<LI>Surface/proximity burst</LI>
<LI>Surface/contact burst</LI></UL></P>

<h3>Development</h3>
<P>Designed and developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)</P>

<P>Mk-21 RV formerly known as the ABRV (Advanced Ballistic Reentry Vehicle) developed by AVCO Systems Division. Heavier, but higher accuracy and lower cost than the Mk-12A. Tests of the Mk-21's hardness to nuclear effects were conducted in 1984-86:<UL>
<LI>Midas Myth/Milagro (Operation Fusileer) 15 May 1984</LI>
<LI>Misty Rain (Operation Grenadier) 6 April 1985</LI>
<LI>Mighty Oak (Operation Charioteer) 10 April 1986 </LI><UL></P>

<P>Design traces its origin to the LASL device tested in the 250 Kt Almendro shot (Operation Toggle), 6 June 1973 (13:00:00.08 UCT). 10 nuclear tests were required to certify the W-87 for stockpiling, including a full yield test prior to March 1976. These tests were complete by mid-1983. The Jefferson shot (Operation Charioteer) 22 April 1986 14:30:00.086 (UCT), 20-150 Kt, may have been a stockpile confidence test of the first production unit, possibly connected with one-point safety concerns.</P>

<P>Development of a higher yield Mod 1 for use on the (now cancelled) single warhead Small ICBM (SICBM or Midgetman) was begun in November 1987, but placed on hold in July 1988. This warhead was to have a higher yield than the Mod 0, which probably indicates the use of the oralloy ring upgrade option for a 475 Kt yield. The U.S. DOE began a life-extension program for W-87 in September 1994. This program is intended to extend the life of the warhead to 2020.</P>

<h3>Deployment</h3>
<P>Initial manufacture April 1986<BR>
Initial operating capability (10 MX missiles) achieved on 22 December 1986 at Warren AFB<BR>
Full deployment December 1988</P>
<P>Originally over 1000 W87s were planned (10 for each of 100 MX missiles).  MX deployment was later cut to 50. Some of the warheads are Alt 323 modifications.</P>
<P>Total production: 525 W87-0 warheads</P>

The W-87-0 will remain in the active stockpile under START II, equipping Minuteman III missiles instead of Peacekeepers.
