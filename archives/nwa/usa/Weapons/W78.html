<P>The W-78 is the warhead used with the Mk 12A reentry vehicle which arms a portion of the Minuteman III ICBM force. Designed for use on MIRV (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicle) bus upper stage. The W-78 replaced part of the W-62 to provide an increased hard target kill capability by increasing both accuracy and yield.</P>

<h3>Fuzing and Delivery Mode</h3>

<h3>Development</h3>
<P>Designed and developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)</P>

<P>The W-78 is based on earlier secondary stage designs, probably including the W-50 Pershing warhead. The primary of the W-78 has been test fired, but the warhead has never been successfully tested at full yield. The W-78 prototype was first fired shortly before the May 1976 Threshold Test Ban Treaty went into effect, possibly in Keelson (4 February 1976) at 200 Kt, which was apparently a disappointing yield. Redesign followed, and LANL challenged LASL's estimate of the design's yield capability. Following a special review by a panel headed by former LLNL director John Foster which supported LASL's claims, production engineering was resumed.

<h3>Deployment</h3>
<P>Initial manufacture August 1979<BR>
Initial deployment in December 1979, replacing W-62s already deployed on Minuteman IIIs. Deployment completed in February 1983.<BR>
1083 W-78 warheads have been manufactured.<BR>
Currently in service: 920 warheads<BR>

Some of these warheads will probably continue in service under START II, the reminder will be kept in the ready "hedge" stockpile.
