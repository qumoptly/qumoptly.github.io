<P>The W-84 is the warhead formerly used on the ground launched cruise missiles (GLCM) which was scrapped under the INF (Intermediate Nuclear Forces) Treaty. It now exists as the sole warhead in the inactive stockpile (eventually to be joined by B61, W62, W76, and W80 warheads also). As an inactive warhead, it lacks the tritium required for operation at anything above its lowest yield. Along with the W80 it is part of the B61 derived warhead family.</P>

<h2>Design Features</h2>
<P>Two stage radiation implosion weapon.</P>
<P>The W-84 is based on the W-61 design, so the exterior appearance of the two warheads is probably very similar (if not identical). This is also true of other B-61 derivatives: the W-80 (still in the active stockpile), the W-81 (no longer in existence), and the W-85 (converted to the B-61). See B61 and  W80 for discussion of probable design features. Specifically, it is a modified B61 Mod 3/4 design.</P>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<P>Primary design probably beryllium reflected plutonium core.<BR>
Deuterium-tritium boosted<BR>
Contains oralloy, probably in the fusion pusher/tamper to create enhanced fission yield from fusion neutrons<BR>
Probably contains lithium-6 (95% enrichment) deuteride fusion fuel<BR>
Uses LX-17 insensitive high explosive (IHE) as main explosive - a TATB plastic bonded explosive composition.
</P>

<H3>Delivery Method</H3>
<P>Originally ground launched cruise missile, which has been scrapped. Probably could be adapted to use in other cruise missiles, or bombs relatively easily.</P>

<H3>Safeguards and Arming Features</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Category F PAL</LI>
<LI>Command disable</LI>
<LI>Unique signal generator</LI>
<LI>Final arming occurs only in target area as determined by guidance system</LI>
<LI>Steel encased critical components</LI>
<LI>Mechanical safing and arming device (MSAD)</LI></UL>
<P>See <a href="Pal.html">Principles of Nuclear Weapons Security and Safety</a> for explanations of these features.

<h3>Fuzing and Delivery Mode</h3>
Airburst or surface burst

<h3>Development</h3>
<P>Designed and developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Suffered some development problems, including a substandard yield on a simulated aging proof test conducted after deployment. The problem was successfully corrected and proof fired without modifying the nuclear assembly subsystem.</P>

<h3>Deployment</h3>
<P>Initial manufacture of W84 was June 1984<BR>
Post deployment stockpile problems noted.<BR>
Initial deployment of W84 on GLCM was December 1983<BR>
350 W84 warheads were manufactured.</PR>
<P>The 350 W84 warheads will be retained indefinitely in the inactive stockpile</P>
