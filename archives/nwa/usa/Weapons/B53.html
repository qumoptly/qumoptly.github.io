<P>The Mk/B-53 is the oldest and highest yield nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal. It is currently being removed from service as it is replaced by the B61-11.</P>

<h2>Design Features</h2>
<P>Two stage radiation implosion weapon
<P>Basic warhead design the same as in the W-53 warhead deployed on the Titan-II ICBM (now out of service).
<P>Rear portion of bomb consists of parachute system, weighing 800-900 lb. The nose is made of a frangible aluminum honeycomb "shock absorber" for laydown delivery and weighs more than 150 lb.
<P>Characteristics of the W-53, and the Hardtack Phase I test devices, indicate that the actual warhead "physics package" is no more 
than 102 inches long by 36.52 inches in diameter, with a weight of ~6000 lb. The skin on the 50 inch in diameter bomb is described as "fragile", consistent with it being only a light weight structure housing a smaller diameter weapon. The added length comes primarily from the B-53 parachute system and frangible nose, the excess weight from these and the dummy body.</P>
<P>Although there is only one reported yield for this weapon, the two variants produced - the "dirty" Y1 and the "clean" Y2 - suggest that two different yields may exist.

<h3>Materials</h3>
<P>Fissile material is all-oralloy (highly enriched uranium), no plutonium<BR>
Lithium-6 (95% enrichment) deuteride fusion fuel<BR>
Cyclotol or Composition B high explosive (castable RDX/TNT mixtures), not insensitive</P>
<P>The B53-Y1 is a "dirty" version (with a U-238 encased secondary). The B53-Y2 is a "clean" version, perhaps with a lead or tungsten secondary casing.

<H3>Delivery Method</H3>
<P>B-52G strategic bomber (internal bomb bay)</P>

<H3>Safeguards and Arming Features</H3>
<P>Originally lacked modern arming and safing features, but has been given a life extension upgrade. Probably uses mechanical lock on firing system.</P>

<h3>Fuzing and Delivery Mode</h3>
<P>Selected on ground prior to mission.<BR>
Four fuzing options: 
<UL>
<LI>Laydown delayed surface burst
<LI>Free fall air burst
<LI>Parachute retarded air burst
<LI>Immediate contact surface burst</UL></P>

<P>Five parachutes are used: <UL><LI>three 48 ft main chutes<LI>one 16 ft extractor chute<LI>
 one 5 ft "pilot" chute.</UL>
The three main chutes are deployed only for laydown delivery. The entire parachute system is jettisoned for free fall delivery.</P>

<h3>Development</h3>
<P>Designed and developed by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL). The Mk-53 apparently can trace a design lineage back to the very first solid-fuel radiation implosion device ever tested, the Shrimp detonated in the Castle Bravo test. The Shrimp design was weaponized into the lighter and more compact Mk-21. Later, an even smaller and lighter high yield weapon designated the Mk-46 was developed from the Mk-21. After a test failure in Operation Hardtack I, the TX-46 secondary was redesigned and generated a high yield on a retest. This revised design was assigned the designation TX-53, and developed into a deployed weapon. Although opportunity to test the production version of the Mk-53 existed during Dominic I and II, it appears that the only test of the Mk-53 design at full yield was the Hardtack I retest, before the TX/Mk-53 designation had even been assigned.<BR>
<P>Current models are the B53-Y1 and the B53-Y2, which are "dirty" and "clean" versions. The last 50 B-53 bombs finally began retirement from active service at the beginning of 1997 (although they remain part of the enduring stockpile). The role assigned to the B-53, destroying buried command centers, is being taken over by the B61-11 ground penetrating warhead.</P>

<h3>Deployment</h3>
<P>Initial manufacture August 1962<BR>
Initial deployment 1962<BR>
Approximately 340 B-53 bombs were manufactured between August 1962 and June 
1965 at the AEC's Burlington , Iowa final assembly plant.</P>
<P>Retirement of the initial model began in July 1967</P>
<P>In the mid-80s plans were made to retire and dismantle the B-53 and replace it with the B-83. On 5 August 1987, with 25 remaining in service, it was decided to halt retirement, and return  to service another 25 that had been retired but not dismantled (the only time this has happened in the U.S.). The stated reason for this decision was to retain the ability to destroy deeply buried hard targets.
<P>In the late 80s a life extension program for the B-53 was begun, which included upgrades to the safing equipment. 
<P>The new earth-penetrating B-61 modification, the Mod 11, began entering service in January 1997 and is replacing the B-53 in active service. Under current plans the B-53 will be retained indefinitely as part of the hedge stockpile.</P>

<P>65 W-53s originally deployed, now withdrawn and dismantled</P>
