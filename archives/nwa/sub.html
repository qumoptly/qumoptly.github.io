              <p>Right now, across the world, there are students taking or planning on taking courses on the history of the atomic bomb. The history of the bomb has been and will probably always be (for better or worse) a relevant topic, and students are drawn to it for a variety of reasons. Some are better than others&#8230;</p>
              <p>Fortunately for these students, writing really impressive term papers on the atomic bomb is easier today than it has probably ever been, in part because the amount of primary source research material about the history of nuclear weapons available through the web is actually quite large — if you know where to go.</p>
              <p>Below is a list of the most useful web archives relevant to writing papers on the atomic bomb that I have come across in my own research. My intention is to keep this somewhat up to date over time, and I&#8217;d love feedback, in the comments or via e-mail, if I&#8217;ve missed something, or something goes dead. I&#8217;ve omitted academic journals, magazines (for the most part), and blogs, just because this would be a somewhat unmanageable list and one of a very different character. This list is for primary sources only, and those available without stepping foot into an actual archive. Some are pretty specific in what they cover, and some are more general.</p>
              <p>I&#8217;ve divided them up into open (free) access databases, subscription-only databases, and a few other miscellaneous useful resources. I don&#8217;t know how common the subscription databases are among university libraries these days — I was long spoiled by Harvard Library&#8217;s copious e-resources — but at least knowing what is out there might be useful for people.</p>

                      <a href="https://www.osti.gov/opennet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOE OpenNet</a></strong>: The Department of Energy OpenNet system is a vestige of the &#8220;Openness&#8221; policies of the early 1990s, back when the Cold War had just ended. It was apparently meant to be a huge repository for declassified documents, but in practice there are only a handful of archives that have contributed materials. Most prominent of these are the records of the
                    <strong>Nuclear Testing Archive</strong>in Las Vegas, Nevada. The NTA (just off of the strip, attached to the
                    <a href="http://www.atomictestingmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic Testing Museum</a>) is a huge archive of nuclear testing related documents that has its origins in the &#8220;atomic veterans&#8221; and other test exposure compensation suits some decades back. Anyway, the underlying point is that OpenNet has a HUGE number of documents online as PDFs, and anything that is from the NTA (easily noticeable by the NV in its document number) and isn&#8217;t online can be requested from the NTA as a PDF. Basically you can send the NTA a request for up to 100 documents per month,

They&#8217;re pretty quick about it and it&#8217;s a great deal (a flat fee for shipping and handling). The index isn&#8217;t great (dates, names, and titles only, with misspellings rampant — my favorite being &#8220;Heroshima&#8221; on one of them) so sometimes it pays to just request 100 documents of any interest and then sort through them to find the five or six that are actually valuable. But it&#8217;s a great resource, and their online files have increased a lot over the past few years.</li>

It&#8217;s also the most heavily radiologically polluted site in the Americas, and a truly massive and important site of Cold War science and politics. The Hanford DDRS has 130,000 or so records relating to life at Hanford over its whole span, including 77,000 photographs. 
                    <b>*NOTE:</b>as of October 2013 this database is offline. I sent them an e-mail and they said that: &#8220;Our cyber security folks had to take down the archive to fix vulnerabilities found in the system. We want to put the archive back up on a .gov website again, but we don&#8217;t have a timeline for accomplishing that right now. In the meantime, we don&#8217;t have an external way to search the database, but will still fulfill any specific requests you have for documents from the archive.&#8221; After a little more prodding they told me that: &#8220;We looking to get the archive hosted again as a pilot on another .gov site. If it works out we&#8217;ll have lots of other public documents on there eventually too.&#8221;

It contains mostly official reports and official correspondence. It&#8217;s great if you want to know about specific test series — e.g. typing in &#8220;Castle&#8221; or &#8220;Argus&#8221; into the search field turns up a lot of interesting things. They are stored as plain PDFs which is excellent, and they seem full-text searchable. The search engine is a little buggy and will occasionally turn up a &#8220;file not found&#8221; page if you try to modify your searches, but if you keep going back to the main link, it works.

This seems to have hit a snag in 2002 when all of said documents were put behind a security wall, despite being declassified. Carey Sublette and Greg Walker managed to cobble together what seems like a pretty extensive mirror of all of those reports, which is pretty great, and is hosted various places (notably at Federation of American Scientists).

This database was always the old standby for how to look up Congressional hearings on microfiche, but in 2008 or so they managed to digitize essentially all of their hearings as full-text searchable PDFs (!!) which is really a wonderful resource. These include the hearings of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (JCAE), and also include the unpublished &#8220;Executive&#8221; (classified) sessions. Now this latter category is a complete gem and being able to access them through searchable PDFs, rather than clunky microfiche, is going to transform our understanding of the JCAE&#8217;s role in things, just because it&#8217;s so easy to search. To search only the unpublished records of the JCAE, do the following: in &#8220;Advanced Search,&#8221; make your first field be &#8220;AEJ&#8221; and searching in &#8220;all fields except full text&#8221;; make your second field be &#8220;unpublished,&#8221; and also set it to &#8220;all fields except full text&#8221;; set your third field is whatever word you want to search for in the full text, and set it to &#8220;all fields including full text&#8221;; lastly, make sure to set your range to a particular Congress or &#8220;Any Congress.&#8221; AEJ is the code for the JCAE, and all &#8220;Executive&#8221; sessions are labeled as &#8220;unpublished.&#8221; Another useful code is &#8220;UAH&#8221;, which limits your search to the House Un-American Activities Committee.</li>

So for me, this required downloading all of them, using Adobe Acrobat Pro to stitch them together into big files, and then breaking them up again into more coherent divisions (e.g. according to folders or reels).

Basically, while General Groves was making the Smyth Report for public release, he also set people on the task of making a classified history of the Manhattan Project. The goal was so that if someone came to him later and asked how they had done things, Groves would be able to quickly refer back to a basic summary of whatever division there was. It was not made for public consumption and is not even fully available because of security reasons, but it&#8217;s still an interesting document. It is the sort of gruff, administrative history you&#8217;d expect Groves to commission — everything he does was for a logical reason, of course, and was entirely warranted by the facts on the ground — but it&#8217;s a nice place to start, especially for the most obscure parts of the Manhattan Project. (I found it useful for my study of Manhattan Project patenting practices because it was the only place where actual statistics on the Patent Division were kept.) A somewhat abridged copy of its Finding Aid is online

(Those labeled as not their entire file have only parts of their file online, those which relate specifically to the Rosenberg case.) Unfortunately many of the really interesting FBI files (e.g. Robert Oppenheimer&#8217;s full file) are not online. The Robert Oppenheimer file is available on microfilm in a number of libraries, and the full Klaus Fuchs file can be purchased as PDFs on two CD-ROMs from the FBI for a mere $30 ($15 per CD). Just send a fax to the FBI&#8217;s

Note that I only know for sure that it&#8217;s &#8220;just this easy&#8221; for the Fuchs file, which is one that has been requested many times before. Requesting arbitrary FBI files takes a bit more work and can take a long time (a few years, sometimes) to process, depending on the collection. So I wouldn&#8217;t build that into your term paper plans unless it is Fuchs, and even then, I&#8217;d get started early on requesting the CDs.</li></ul>
