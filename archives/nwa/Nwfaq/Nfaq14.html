<h2>Section 14. Nuclear Weapons FAQ Change History</h2>

<h4>This revision (Version 2.26: 13 March 2019) is probably the last one for this section, which is to announce the it is frozen and will not be updated anymore. When this project started more than 25 years ago, I provided version change tracking for the convenience of users, both within the NWFAQ, and for the website when I began hosting it myself. Maintaining versions on each page, and here, and on the website pages, as I originally did, is just too much of maintenance burden making version change notations in multiple places every time an edit was made, and for very little value. This has become an historical document (part of the Library of Congress Permanent Collection, for example, so rather than deleting this, I am just leaving this as is.</h4>
