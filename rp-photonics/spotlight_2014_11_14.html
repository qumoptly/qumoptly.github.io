<p>Abstract: Correctly designing nonlinear frequency conversion stages is not easy, but has a lot of advantages, making development projects faster and more efficient. Unfortunately, many people take a trial-and-error approach, wasting a lot of resources.</p>

<p><a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="nonlinear frequency conversion: the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">Nonlinear frequency conversion</a> is often used in laser technology &ndash; in conjunction with <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="continuous-wave operation: operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> lasers and <a href="pulsed_lasers.html" title="pulsed lasers: lasers emitting light in the form of pulses">pulsed lasers</a>.
In similar ways as for <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a>, the correct design of frequency conversion stages is essential: not only for obtaining the optimum power conversion efficiency, but also for preserving <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, achieving a sufficiently high lifetime of the <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="nonlinear crystal materials: crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal material</a>, etc.
And indeed there are quite a few design details where the correct choice is certainly not obvious.
In particular, you have to decide about what type and length of nonlinear crystal to use, what <a href="phase_matching.html" title="phase matching: a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase-matching</a> configuration to employ (e.g. <a href="critical_phase_matching.html" title="critical phase matching: phase matching of a nonlinear interaction by adjustment of a propagation direction">critical</a> or <a href="noncritical_phase_matching.html" title="noncritical phase matching: a technique of phase matching which does not require a critical angular adjustment">noncritical</a>?), how tightly the <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> should be focused into the crystal, etc.
For <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a>, in particular for <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>, a number of additional aspect comes into play; one may have to consider the <a href="phase_matching_bandwidth.html" title="phase-matching bandwidth: the width of an optical frequency range in which some process (e.g. a nonlinear interaction) can be efficient due to more or less precise phase matching">phase-matching bandwidth</a> or the <a href="group_velocity_mismatch.html" title="group velocity mismatch: the phenomenon that pulses become temporally separated in a medium due to different group velocities, or (quantitatively) the difference of inverse group velocities">group velocity mismatch</a> or peak intensities in the context of possible <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">laser-induced damage</a>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, a large percentage of people developing laser devices still use a trial-and-error approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, they select a certain crystal simply because that material has been used successfully in another device, even though the circumstances are quite different.</li>
<li>They would purchase dozens of crystals with a certain length, not knowing whether half the length (which certainly makes it much cheaper) would be sufficient or possibly even better.</li>
<li>They would just take some curved <a href="mirrors.html" title="mirrors: devices which reflect light">mirror</a> or <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a> to focus their laser beam into the crystal, neither knowing what size the <a href="beam_waist.html" title="beam waist: location with minimum beam radius">beam waist</a> will have, nor what value would be appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the conversion efficiency appears to be satisfactory, they would conclude that it works and can be done that way.
If the boss later asks for more conversion efficiency, they do not know whether it would be possible.
How far the applied intensity levels are from the <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">laser-induced damage</a> threshold is another question they could not answer &ndash; although the boss would certainly want them to know that!</p>
<p>That style of working is nicely complemented by similar practices among those selling nonlinear crystal materials, for example.
Often, they know little concerning the trade-offs between different materials (except that their material is best, of course!), have no justified idea concerning an optimum crystal length, etc.
Effectively, they tell their buyers: &ldquo;I don't know how that stuff really works; just buy it and try yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quite obviously, this is not the recommended way of working in a high-tech area like <a href="photonics.html" title="photonics: the science and technology of light">photonics</a>.
It is highly inefficient, possibly leading to poor performance, unnecessary cost for materials and parts, time-consuming problems with optical damage, etc.
But why are people working like this?
Possibly just because they cannot do it better, and believe that they could not do it better.
Learning often does not appear to be a contemplated option.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there is no fast way of learning all this.
One first needs to acquire a thorough understanding of the underlying physics, including the knowledge of calculating details such as <a href="phase_matching.html" title="phase matching: a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase-matching</a> angles, intensity-dependent conversion efficiencies and the like.
In addition, one needs to get familiar e.g. with the typical trade-offs between different phase-matching configurations and the typical pros and cons of tight focusing into nonlinear crystals.
Finally, one also requires some amount of experience e.g. in order to notice that certain degradation phenomena have to be observed when using particular nonlinear crystal materials.</p>
<p>When learning all this just for using it once for the design of a device, the amount of work required may be out of proportion.
However, when somebody at a company regularly designs such devices, that investment into solid know-how will certainly pay off.
And if a company does not often uses that sort of expertise, the straightforward solution is to employ an expert as an external technical consultant for getting this work done properly.
Note that paying such an expert for just a few hours of work is nothing compared to what you can waste when trying silly things in the lab.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Enjoy a one-day course on nonlinear frequency conversion on Feb. 9, 2015 &ndash; the probably easiest way of getting well introduced into that area!</aside>
<p>By the way, I will present a one-day course on <a href="http://spie.org/PW/course/applied-nonlinear-frequency-conversion">Applied Nonlinear Frequency Conversion</a> at Photonics West (San Francisco) on February 9, 2015.
This would be an excellent opportunity for many to get an easy introduction into that technical area.
Those already knowing the basics can still learn a lot in this course.</p>
<p>Besides, I'm also offering tailored <a href="training.html">staff training courses</a>, performed at my customer's premises.
That way, a whole team may learn a lot of things within just two or three days, for example</p>

<h2>Trouble with Specifications</h2>
<p>Specifications for lasers and other photonics products are essential for the process of buying such things.
Nevertheless, many do not properly deal with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many product specifications by suppliers lack quality &ndash; they are incomplete, not sufficiently clear, etc.</li>
<li>Buyers are often not aware of what they really need. For example, they forget essential requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various problems can arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to a lack of clarity, tedious communications between supplier and buyer are required.</li>
<li>Product specifications raise expectations which cannot be met.</li>
<li>Conflicts can arise over such issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="spotlight_2013_12_133395.html?banner=specifications">Photonics Spotlight article</a> and our <a href="laser_specifications3395.html?banner=specifications">encyclopedia article on laser specifications</a> give you important hints.

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="spotlight_2009_10_1930d7.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
