<h2 class="togglediv">Part 10: Chromatic Dispersion of Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">Chromatic dispersion</a> is the phenomenon that the <a href="phase_velocity.html" title="phase velocity: the velocity with which phase fronts propagate in a medium">phase velocity</a> and the <a href="group_velocity.html" title="group velocity: the velocity with which the envelope of a weak narrow-band optical pulse propagates in a medium">group velocity</a> of light propagating in a fiber depend on the <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="optical frequency: the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>.
It is relevant for many applications of <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="fiber optics: optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a>.
For example, it has a strong influence on the propagation of telecom signals in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> and on the propagation of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Origins of Chromatic Dispersion</h3>
<div>
<p>In optical fibers, dispersion arises from two totally different origins:</p>
<ul>
<li>The glass material has some <em>material dispersion</em>, which applies e.g. to a plane wave propagating in a homogeneous piece of that glass.
This means that the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> is wavelength-dependent.</li>
<li>There is also <a href="waveguide_dispersion.html" title="waveguide dispersion: chromatic dispersion arising from waveguiding effects"><em>waveguide dispersion</em></a>: the chromatic dispersion is modified due to the fact that in a fiber we do not have plane waves (even though the fiber <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a> usually have plane wavefronts), but spatially confined light waves.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Understanding Waveguide Dispersion</h3>
<div>
<p>Waveguide dispersion is more easily understood by considering a somewhat artificial case: a step-index fiber where the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>, seen from an end face, is has a square instead of circular shape, with a width <span class="eqn_il"><i>a</i></span> in <span class="eqn_il"><i>x</i></span> and <span class="eqn_il"><i>y</i></span> direction.
We also assume a high index contrast, so that at least the low-order modes have essentially no intensity outside the core.
In this situation, each mode field is (within the fiber core) essentially a superposition of four plane waves.
There are two with a <a href="wave_vector.html" title="wave vector: a vector indicating the direction of wave propagation and the phase delay per unit length">wave vector</a> component in <span class="eqn_il">&plusmn;<i>x</i></span> direction and two more with a wave vector in <span class="eqn_il">&plusmn;<i>y</i></span> direction.</p>
<p>As the mode field must vanish at the edges of the core, the <span class="eqn_il"><i>x</i></span> components of the wave vector must satisfy the condition <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>&thinsp;<i>a</i>&thinsp;=&thinsp;<i>j</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>&thinsp;<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span> with a positive integer mode index <span class="eqn_il"><i>j</i><sub><i>x</i></sub></span>.
(<span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i><sub><i>x</i></sub></span> is the phase advance per unit length in <span class="eqn_il"><i>x</i></span> direction.)
An analogous rule holds for the <span class="eqn_il"><i>y</i></span> direction.
Figure&nbsp;1 shows the transverse amplitude profile for <span class="eqn_il"><i>j</i><sub><i>x</i></sub></span> = 3 and <span class="eqn_il"><i>j</i><sub><i>y</i></sub></span> = 4.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/square_waveguide_mode.png" alt="amplitude profile of a waveguide mode">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Amplitude profile of a mode of a fiber with square-shaped core.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the chromatic dispersion, what matters is the phase advance in <span class="eqn_il"><i>z</i></span> direction.
The <a href="propagation_constant.html" title="propagation constant: a mode- and frequency-dependent quantity describing the propagation of light in a medium or waveguide">phase constant</a> is:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/beta_sq_fiber.gif" width="162" height="54" alt="beta value of a fiber mode"></div>
<p>This results from a simple calculation: we have a certain magnitude of the wave vector, determined by the wavelength and the refractive index <span class="eqn_il"><i>n</i></span> of the core, and that wave vector has transverse and longitudinal components which add up according to the law of Pythagoras.</p>
<p>We see now that higher-order modes have lower phase constants <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&beta;</span></span>, basically because their wave vector components are more strongly tilted against the fiber axis.
This means that their <a href="phase_velocity.html" title="phase velocity: the velocity with which phase fronts propagate in a medium">phase velocities</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>v</i><sub>ph</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;<span class="greek">&omega;</span>&thinsp;/&thinsp;<span class="greek">&beta;</span></span> are higher than that of the fundamental (lowest-order) mode.</p>
<p>The <a href="group_velocity.html" title="group velocity: the velocity with which the envelope of a weak narrow-band optical pulse propagates in a medium">group velocity</a> is the inverse of the derivative <span class="eqn_il"><i>d<span class="greek">&beta;</span></i>&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>d<span class="greek">&omega;</span></i></span>.
As each mode has wavelength-independent transverse components, its <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&beta;</span></span> rises faster with frequency for higher-order modes.
(The increase of <span class="eqn_il">2<span class="greek">&pi;</span><i>n</i>&thinsp;/&thinsp;<span class="greek">&lambda;</span></span> with increasing frequency without an increase of the transverse component means a faster rise of the longitudinal component.)
Therefore, higher-order modes have lower group velocities.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Dispersion of a Multimode Fiber</h3>
<div>
<p>In a real fiber, we normally have a more complicated situation due to a circular symmetry, possibly smooth index profiles and modes which extend significantly into the cladding.
However, various basic aspects are essentially the same as in the example discussed above.
As a more realistic example, let us look at the modes of a multimode germanosilicate fiber.
Figure&nbsp;2 shows the index profile and the radial mode functions.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/germanosilicate_fiber2.png" alt="radial profiles of fiber modes">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Radial profiles of mode function, index profile and effective indices.
Different colors are used for different <span class="eqn_il"><i>l</i></span> values.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure&nbsp;3 shows the group indices of the modes.
(The group velocity is <span class="eqn_il"><i>c</i></span> divided by the <a href="group_index.html" title="group index: the ratio of the vacuum velocity of light to the group velocity in a medium">group index</a>.)
They rise at short wavelengths due to the material dispersion.
The two gray dashed curves show the values for the core (at its center) and the cladding; the group indices of the modes a largely higher than these two, already indicating the additional effect of waveguide dispersion.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/germanosilicate_fiber6.png" alt="group index of fiber modes">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
Group indices of all modes versus wavelength.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Near a mode cut-off, the group index often drops, i.e., the group velocity rises.
This is related to the weaker mode confinement in that regime.
For modes with <span class="eqn_il"><i>l</i>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0</span> (black curves), the group velocity can approach that of the cladding.</p>
<p>We can finally look at the <a href="group_velocity_dispersion.html" title="group velocity dispersion: the frequency dependence of the group velocity in a medium, or (quantitatively) the derivative of the inverse group velocity with respect to angular frequency">group velocity dispersion</a>.
This is essentially the frequency derivative of the group velocity.
Figure&nbsp;4 shows how the group velocities of all modes evolve with wavelength.
These are normally between the values for core and cladding at wavelengths far below mode cut-off, and rise for wavelengths close to cut-off.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/germanosilicate_fiber7.png" alt="group velocity dispersion of fiber modes">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span> 
Group velocity dispersion of all modes versus wavelength.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>(See also a more complete <a href="fiberpower_gesi.html">description of the used simulation model</a>.)</p>
<p>Of course, the dispersion properties depend on the detailed refractive index profile.
This gives us the opportunity, for example, to tailor the dispersion properties of <a href="telecom_fibers.html" title="telecom fibers: optical fibers for use in optical fiber communications">telecom fibers</a>.
That is done particularly for <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a> used in long-haul data transmission.
For example, there are <a href="dispersion_shifted_fibers.html" title="dispersion-shifted fibers: fibers with a non-standard zero dispersion wavelength">dispersion-shifted fibers</a> with a W-shaped index profile, where the <a href="zero_dispersion_wavelength.html" title="zero dispersion wavelength: a wavelength where the group delay dispersion of a fiber or a material is zero">zero dispersion wavelength</a> has been shifted from the 1.3-&mu;m region (where it would naturally be for single-mode <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>) to the 1.5-&mu;m region, where modern telecom systems using <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a> operate.
Zero dispersion is actually not always beneficial; one also uses <em>dispersion-flattened fibers</em>, having a reduced wavelength dependence of the group velocity dispersion, i.e., low higher-order dispersion.</p>
<aside class="textbox tb_right redmargin" style="width:215px;">
<h2>Optimizing Fiber Designs</h2>
<p>The software <a href="rp_fiber_calculator.html"><b>RP Fiber Calculator PRO</b></a> allows one to optimize fiber designs, e.g. concerning chromatic dispersion.
One can change the design simply by clicking into the displayed index or doping profile, and immediately see the resulting figure-of-merit value(s).</p>
</aside>
<p>Unfortunately, one cannot obtain arbitrary dispersion profiles.
For the common all-glass fibers, there are serious limitations.
For example, one cannot obtain anomalous dispersion (negative GVD) in the visible wavelength range.
Note also that one cares about various aspects, e.g. <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a>, <a href="bend_losses.html" title="bend losses: propagation losses in an optical fiber (or other waveguide) caused by bending">bend losses</a> and fabrication tolerances, and there can be trade-offs.</p>
<p>A far higher degree of dispersion control is possible with <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="photonic crystal fibers: specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a>, containing tiny air holes.
The placement of air holes gives a lot of room for optimizations.
Here, one can e.g. obtain anomalous dispersion in the visible wavelength range.
Note that calculations are more difficult for such fibers, having a high refractive index contrast, and partly being based on different light guiding principles.</p>
<p>Note, however, that none of these approaches has a potential for dispersion control in <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fibers</a>.
Such large modes always have phase constants (<span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&beta;</span></span> values) close to the <a href="wavenumber.html" title="wavenumber: the phase delay per unit length, or that quantity divided by 2&pi;">wavenumber</a> in the corresponding fiber core material, with very small effects of waveguide dispersion.
This is essentially because large modes have a similar dispersion behavior like plane waves, with weak diffraction and waveguiding effects.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Dispersion in Fiber-optic Links</h3>
<div>
<p>One might think that chromatic dispersion is always bad for the transmission of telecom signals in <a href="fiber_optic_links.html" title="fiber-optic links: optical communication links where the signal light is transported in fibers">fiber-optic links</a>, as it tends to temporally spread and distort signals.
Indeed, chromatic dispersion (as well as intermodal dispersion) can introduce a <em>dispersion power penalty</em>, i.e., one needs more optical power to achieve the same bit rate.
Therefore, it appeared for a while that one should either operate fiber-optic links in the 1.3-&mu;m wavelength region, close to the <a href="zero_dispersion_wavelength.html" title="zero dispersion wavelength: a wavelength where the group delay dispersion of a fiber or a material is zero">zero-dispersion wavelength</a> (ZDW) of standard <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>, or use <a href="dispersion_shifted_fibers.html" title="dispersion-shifted fibers: fibers with a non-standard zero dispersion wavelength">dispersion-shifted fibers</a> with the ZDW in the 1.5-&mu;m wavelength region, where <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a> can be used.
It turned out, however, that particularly when using <a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="wavelength division multiplexing: a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain">wavelength division multiplexing</a> it is better to have some amount of dispersion, as that mitigates nonlinear effects.
See <a href="passive_fiber_optics11.html">part 11 on fiber nonlinearities</a> and <a href="passive_fiber_optics12.html">part 12 on pulses and signals</a> for some more details.</p>
