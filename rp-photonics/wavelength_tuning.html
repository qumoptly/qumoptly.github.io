<p>For some applications, it is required that the wavelength of a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> can be tuned within some range.
Whereas the article on <a href="tunable_lasers.html" title="tunable lasers: lasers the output wavelengths of which can be tuned">tunable lasers</a> discusses various types of lasers which have an adjustable output wavelength, this article explains several methods of wavelength tuning.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Tuning via the Gain Medium</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:292px;">
<img src="img/tuning_via_gain.png" alt="wavelength tuning by shifting the gain">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Wavelength tuning by shifting the laser gain spectrum.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first method is to influence the <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> in such a way that the wavelength of maximum <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> is changed, and the output wavelength adjusts accordingly (Figure&nbsp;1).
This method is often applied to lasers with operation on multiple resonator modes, where the &ldquo;center of gravity&rdquo; of the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="optical spectrum: the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> may be tuned fairly continuously.
When the method is applied to <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="single-frequency lasers: lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency lasers</a>, it usually leads to <a href="mode_hopping.html" title="mode hopping: the phenomenon that a laser exhibits sudden jumps of optical frequency, which are associated with transitions between different modes of its resonator">mode hopping</a>.</p>
<p><a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">Laser diodes</a> are often tuned via the temperature, e.g. by changing the drive current of a thermoelectric cooler on which the laser diode is mounted, or the drive current of the laser diode itself.
Typically, laser diodes tune by &asymp;&thinsp;+0.3&nbsp;nm/K, and the total tuning range achieved in that way may be a few nanometers wide.
The resonator mode frequencies are also affected by the temperature change, but they react less strongly than the gain spectrum.
In the case of <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="single-frequency operation: an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency operation</a>, continuous tuning over a wider range may be achieved if appropriate measures are taken to suppress <a href="mode_hopping.html" title="mode hopping: the phenomenon that a laser exhibits sudden jumps of optical frequency, which are associated with transitions between different modes of its resonator">mode hopping</a>.
For example, the resonator length may be tuned together with the drive current in the case of an <a href="external_cavity_diode_lasers.html" title="external-cavity diode lasers: non-monolithic diode lasers where the laser cavity (resonator) is completed with external optical elements">external-cavity diode laser</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Tuning With an Intracavity Filter</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:294px;">
<img src="img/tuning_via_losses.png" alt="wavelength tuning via resonator losses">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Wavelength tuning via the resonator losses.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The second method is to introduce a tunable <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">optical filter</a> into the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>, which has a pronounced loss minimum at some adjustable wavelength (Figure&nbsp;2).
This makes it possible to influence the wavelength of maximum net gain, at which the laser is usually forced to operate.
More precisely, the laser will usually operate on one or several resonator modes for which the inversion level of the <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> required for lasing (i.e. for generating a <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> which equals the resonator losses) is close to its minimum.
In the steady state (for <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="continuous-wave operation: operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave operation</a>), light at the laser wavelength has zero round trip net gain, and all other wavelengths experience a negative net gain (assuming <a href="homogeneous_broadening.html" title="homogeneous broadening: the increase in the linewidth of an atomic transition caused by effects which affect different radiating or absorbing atoms in the same way">homogeneous broadening</a> of the gain spectrum).</p>
<p>This method is often applied to <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>.
A wide wavelength tuning range of a laser requires a wide <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="gain bandwidth: the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a> of the gain medium.
Some broadband <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain media</a> such as <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers: lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">Ti:sapphire</a> and <a href="chromium_doped_gain_media.html" title="chromium-doped gain media: laser gain media doped with chromium ions">Cr:ZnSe</a> allow tuning over hundreds of nanometers.
The tuning range obtained is usually the wavelength range in which sufficient net <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> can be achieved.
Its limits are often set by the points where the emission <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="transition cross sections: material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a> become too low or the resonator losses become too high.
In some cases, the tuning range may be smaller because there is <a href="excited_state_absorption.html" title="excited-state absorption: absorption of light by ions or atoms in an excited electronic state, rather than in the electronic ground state">excited-state absorption</a>, or because emission at wavelengths with maximum laser gain can not be fully suppressed.
In some <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>, for example, the inversion level (and hence the gain at extreme wavelengths) is limited by <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="amplified spontaneous emission: a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a> near the wavelength of maximum gain.</p>

</figure>
<p>Frequently used tuning elements in <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk laser</a> resonators are:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <a href="etalons.html" title="etalons: monolithic interferometric devices containing two parallel reflecting surfaces">etalon</a> (Fabry&ndash;P&eacute;rot interferometer) or a <a href="birefringent_tuners.html" title="birefringent tuners: devices for wavelength tuning of lasers, based on birefringence and polarization rotation">birefringent tuner</a> (<a href="lyot_filters.html" title="Lyot filters: optical filter devices based on birefringence, exhibiting a wavelength-dependent transmission">Lyot filter</a>) which can be rotated to adjust the wavelength of maximum transmission</li>
<li>a <a href="prism_pairs.html" title="prism pairs: combinations of two prisms, mostly used for dispersion compensation">prism pair</a> in combination with a movable aperture</li>
<li>a single <a href="prisms.html" title="prisms: transparent optical devices which refract or reflect light">prism</a> in combination with and end mirror which can be tilted to adjust the wavelength for which the resonator is well aligned</li>
<li>a <a href="volume_bragg_gratings.html" title="volume Bragg gratings: Bragg gratings written into some bulk material">volume Bragg grating</a> used as a folding mirror with a variable angle of incidence</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="external_cavity_diode_lasers.html" title="external-cavity diode lasers: non-monolithic diode lasers where the laser cavity (resonator) is completed with external optical elements">External-cavity diode lasers</a> can also be tuned with an intracavity filter.
A holographic <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="diffraction gratings: optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction grating</a> can be used as an end mirror (<em>Littrow configuration</em>), which is rotated for tuning, or a fixed grating within the resonator combined with a movable end mirror (<em>Littman configuration</em>).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Tuning via the Resonator Length</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:294px;">
<img src="img/tuning_via_resonator.png" alt="wavelength tuning by shifting the resonance frequencies">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span> 
Wavelength tuning by shifting the resonances frequencies of the modes.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="single-frequency lasers: lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency laser</a> can be tuned within approximately one <a href="free_spectral_range.html" title="free spectral range: frequency spacing of the axial modes of an optical resonator">free spectral range</a> of its resonator by fine adjustment of the resonator length within a range of half a wavelength (for linear resonators) (Figure&nbsp;4).
The principle behind this is that the frequencies of the <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="resonator modes: modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a> are shifted.
Attempts to tune further may cause the laser to <a href="mode_hopping.html" title="mode hopping: the phenomenon that a laser exhibits sudden jumps of optical frequency, which are associated with transitions between different modes of its resonator">mode hop</a> to the next resonator mode, which then has the higher gain.
A wider tuning range can be achieved if the wavelength of maximum gain is also tuned, or with an additional intracavity filter.</p>
<p>Relatively wideband mode-hop-free tunability can be obtained with very short laser cavities.
This is used with, e.g., MEMS <a href="vertical_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers: a monolithic kind of semiconductor lasers with beam emission perpendicular to the wafer surface">VCSELs</a>, having a separate <a href="output_couplers.html" title="output couplers: partially transparent laser mirrors, used for extracting output beams from laser resonators">output coupling mirror</a> the position of which can be tuned via thermal expansion, electrostatic forces, or a piezoelectric element.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Alternative Techniques</h2>
<div>
<p>Wavelength-tunable radiation can also be obtained with alternative techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synchrotron radiation sources (wigglers and undulators, <a href="free_electron_lasers.html" title="free electron lasers: laser devices where light amplification occurs by interaction with fast electrons in an undulator">free electron lasers</a>) allow wavelength tuning via the electron energy.</li>
<li><a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="optical parametric oscillators: coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">Optical parametric oscillators</a> are often tuned by affecting the <a href="phase_matching.html" title="phase matching: a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase-matching</a> conditions.</li>
<li>An <a href="optical_parametric_amplifiers.html" title="optical parametric amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on parametric nonlinear interactions">optical parametric amplifier</a> can be used for amplifying a variable part of a very broad spectrum, as obtained via <a href="supercontinuum_generation.html" title="supercontinuum generation: a nonlinear process for strong spectral broadening of light">supercontinuum generation</a>.</li>
<li>The Raman self-frequency shift in an optical <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> can be exploited for wavelength tuning via the launched power of the pulses.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a very fast periodic sweep of the <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="optical frequency: the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a> is required, an alternative method is available: short optical <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a> are fed through a strongly <a href="dispersion.html" title="dispersion: the dependence of the phase velocity in a medium on the optical frequency or the propagation mode">dispersive</a> element (e.g. a long <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>), so that the different wavelength components exit this element at different times.</p>
