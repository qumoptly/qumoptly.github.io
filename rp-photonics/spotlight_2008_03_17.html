<p>Abstract: This article shows that the development of ultrafast fiber lasers is not just applying known features of mode locking to fiber lasers instead of bulk lasers, but rather involves novel aspects, mainly due to the involved nonlinearities and dispersion. This has important consequences, particularly concerning the technical limitations and the complications of the development process, which requires more physics expertise and is likely to take more time.</p>

<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="mode_locked_fiber_lasers.html" title="mode-locked fiber lasers: ultrafast fiber lasers which are actively or passively mode-locked for generating ultrashort pulses">mode-locked fiber lasers</a>, <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a></p>
<p>The future of <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and competing technologies is currently the subject of an intense debate.
The general topic is enormously complex, but we can pick one sub-topic at a time, such as <a href="mode_locked_fiber_lasers.html" title="mode-locked fiber lasers: ultrafast fiber lasers which are actively or passively mode-locked for generating ultrashort pulses">ultrafast fiber lasers</a>.
Many are impressed by the prospects of replacing more or less sensitive bulk setups with compact fiber-based laser setups, which don't require one to maintain any alignment, can be bent and folded as it is convenient, and are immune to thermal effects at high power levels.
Particularly in the domain of <a href="ultrafast_lasers.html" title="ultrafast lasers: lasers emitting ultrashort pulses">ultrafast lasers</a>, <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth doped fibers</a> offer the additional feature of a substantial <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="gain bandwidth: the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a>, which is compatible with very short <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="pulse duration: the duration of an optical pulse">pulse durations</a>.
Yes, I wrote <em>compatible</em> with short pulse durations, not <em>enabling</em> short pulse durations, because those are often prevented by other issues.
The same applies to high pulse energies.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Just the Same, Now with Fibers?</h2>
<div>
<p>One might expect that after the development of many different <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>, the issues for developing mode-locked fiber lasers would just be the very fiber-specific ones: for example, how to get all the required components in fiber-optic form, and how to optimize the parameters under the given conditions, but not any fundamentals of <a href="mode_locking.html" title="mode locking: a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode locking</a>.
This expectation, however, would be quite wrong.
In a sense, mode locking had to be re-invented for fiber lasers.
The initial approach was to apply various techniques and ideas known from <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>.
However, it was then soon recognized that this implies serious restrictions on the key performance parameters, such as <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="pulse duration: the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> and <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="pulse energy: energy of an optical pulse">pulse energy</a>, mostly due to the strong <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> and partially the <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> of fibers.</p>
<p>It became clear then that only with specially adapted techniques it is possible to reach e.g. pulse energies of multiple nanojoules in 100-fs pulses.
So now we have not only <a href="soliton_mode_locking.html" title="soliton mode locking: a mechanism for laser mode locking based on soliton pulses">soliton lasers</a>, but also <em>stretched-pulse lasers</em>, <em>similariton lasers</em> and other <em>all normal-dispersion fiber lasers</em> &ndash; a family of laser devices with complicated properties and not always very well-defined boundaries between the different brands.
What distinguishes all such fiber lasers from essentially all previous mode-locked lasers is that the <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="Kerr effect: a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr nonlinearity</a> and chromatic dispersion play very strong and mutually coupled roles, and that various pulse parameters (including the <a href="chirp.html" title="chirp: time dependence of the instantaneous frequency of an optical pulse">chirp</a> of <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="optical frequency: the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>) undergo a strong evolution during each resonator round trip.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Consequences</h2>
<div>
<p>These are not just some subtle technical details, relevant only for those who are interested in a precise understanding of how such lasers work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultrafast fiber lasers are still subject to certain performance limitations, and this is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.
After all, nonlinearities and dispersion cannot simply be eliminated.
Measures such as using <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fibers</a> for reducing nonlinear effects do have serious limitations, such as limited availability of <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber couplers: fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a>, <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="optical modulators: devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">modulators</a>, etc.</li>
<li>Particularly (but not only) for realizing performance parameters near the limits, a precise physical understanding is vital.
By trying such a development without that, one can easily get into a nightmare which won't end on the next morning.
(See also the <a href="spotlight_2008_03_17.html">Spotlight article of 2008-03-17</a>.)</li>
<li>Certain mode-locking techniques for fiber lasers make it difficult to obtain an all-fiber setup.
In a way, this can lead to devices which combine the bad features of both domains: an <a href="alignment_sensitivity.html" title="alignment sensitivity: the sensitivity of a laser, an optical resonator or some other device with respect to misalignment">alignment sensitivity</a> worse than that of a regular bulk laser (due to air spaces and the requirement to re-launch light into a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>), the pulse energy limitation of a fiber laser, and possibly a poor pulse quality and the need for external dispersive <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="pulse compression: linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">pulse compression</a>.</li>
<li>Only to a very limited extent, one can use the kind of design guidelines which are very helpful for developing mode-locked bulk lasers.
Numerical <a href="laser_modeling.html" title="laser modeling: the investigation of phenomena and quantitative relations in lasers, using theoretical models and computational methods">laser models</a> are often required for understanding the overall operation principle, the dependence of performance parameters on device parameters, and the limitations of the chosen approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter remark is particularly important: while many nice features can be obtained in different fiber lasers, it is very challenging to combine in a single device the advantages of an all-fiber setup, a relatively high pulse energy, a high pulse energy, a robust and compact setup, and cheap components.
So it may often be wise to consider whether a bulk laser wouldn't be the better solution overall.
For sure, the comparatively simpler physics of mode locking such lasers are likely to result in a faster and cheaper development, which is particularly important for small quantities.
On the other hand, not every application needs all the nice features mentioned above, and particularly for larger volumes it may then be advantageous to go for a fiber laser.
However, my warning is: Never do it without having extensive expertise available for such a project.</p>
