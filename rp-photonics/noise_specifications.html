<p>The strength of <a href="laser_noise.html" title="laser noise: fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">noise</a> e.g. of the output of a <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> often needs to be quantified &ndash; particularly in the context of applications such as <a href="frequency_metrology.html" title="frequency metrology: the field of technology dealing with precise frequency measurements">frequency metrology</a>, sensitive spectroscopic measurements, or <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, where the performance of devices or systems is limited by noise.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Examples of Noise Specifications of Lasers and Optical Amplifiers</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="intensity_noise.html" title="intensity noise: noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">Intensity noise</a> is often measured by analyzing the laser output with a <a href="photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes: semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiode</a> and related electronic equipment such as an electronic spectrum analyzer.
It can be specified with a <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="power spectral density: optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral density</a> of the <a href="relative_intensity_noise.html" title="relative intensity noise: noise of the optical intensity (or actually power), normalized to its average value">relative intensity noise</a> as a function of noise frequency.
For some purposes, a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) value, essentially the square root of the integral of the power spectral density over some frequency range (e.g. 1&nbsp;Hz &ndash; 1&nbsp;MHz), is sufficient.
However, r.m.s. values without specification of the measurement <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> are nonsensical.
That bandwidth is determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The higher frequency limit is often set by the speed of the <a href="photodetectors.html" title="photodetectors: devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a> (including detection electronics).
Obviously, a slow detector is not able to record fast fluctuations, and therefore indicates weaker noise than a fast detector.
For digital recordings, the measurement bandwidth is at most half the sampling frequency (&rarr;&nbsp;<em>Nyquist theorem</em>), and in practice often even lower, as low-pass filtering has to be applied before the sampling in order to avoid aliasing effects.</li>
<li>The lower frequency limit is approximately the inverse measurement time.
When the intensity fluctuations are recorded in some limited time interval, one cannot know how much the average of the recorded power deviates from the average power over longer times.
Therefore, the influence of noise at frequencies below the inverse measurement time is suppressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optical <a href="phase_noise.html" title="phase noise: noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">phase noise</a> can be quantified by the <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="power spectral density: optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral density</a> (PSD) of the <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> fluctuations.
Alternatively, the PSD of the fluctuations of the <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="instantaneous frequency: temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a> can be specified.
Such power spectral densities often diverge for zero frequency, so that integration down to zero frequency is not possible.
For simple random-walk processes, the specification of a <a href="coherence_time.html" title="coherence time: a measure of temporal coherence, expressed as the time over which the field correlation decays">coherence time</a> or <a href="coherence_length.html" title="coherence length: a measure of temporal coherence, expressed as the propagation distance over which the coherence significantly decays">coherence length</a> or of a <a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> value can be appropriate.
Note that linewidth values often depend on the measurement time.</p>
<p><a href="frequency_noise.html" title="frequency noise: noise of the instantaneous frequency of an oscillating signal">Frequency noise</a> is directly related to phase noise; it is the noise of the <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="instantaneous frequency: temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a>, the latter being related to the temporal derivative of the phase.</p>
<p><a href="timing_jitter.html" title="timing jitter: fluctuations of the temporal positions of pulses">Timing jitter</a> of a <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulse</a> train can be quantified as the power spectral density of the timing deviation (e.g. from some noiseless reference) or the <a href="timing_phase.html" title="timing phase: a phase reflecting timing deviations by relating them to the pulse period">timing phase</a>.
It is also common to specify an r.m.s. value for a certain range of noise frequencies.</p>
<p>In <a href="frequency_metrology.html" title="frequency metrology: the field of technology dealing with precise frequency measurements">frequency metrology</a>, the use of a <em>Allan deviation</em> or <em>Allan variance</em> as a function of time is common.
These quantities can be calculated from a power spectral density, whereas the opposite calculation is ambiguous.</p>
<p>The <a href="noise_figure.html" title="noise figure: a measure of the excess noise added in an amplifier">noise figure</a> of an electronic or optical <a href="amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers: devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifier</a> quantifies the <a href="amplifier_noise.html" title="amplifier noise: noise introduced to a signal in an amplifier device">amplifier excess noise</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="frequency_metrology.html" title="frequency metrology: the field of technology dealing with precise frequency measurements">frequency metrology</a>, it is common to use <em>normalized phase fluctuations</em> <span class="eqn_il"><i>x</i>(<i>t</i>)&thinsp;=&thinsp;<span class="greek">&delta;</span><span class="greek">&phi;</span>(<i>t</i>)&thinsp;/&thinsp;(2<span class="greek">&pi;</span>&thinsp;<span class="greek">&nu;</span><sub>0</sub>)</span>, i.e., phase fluctuations divided by the mean angular frequency.
The time derivative of the normalized phase fluctuations then delivers the normalized frequency fluctuations <span class="eqn_il"><i>y</i>(<i>t</i>)</span>, i.e., the fluctuations of the <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="instantaneous frequency: temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a> relative to the mean frequency.
For a comparison of the phase noise of sources with different mean frequencies, it is appropriate to compare the power spectral densities <span class="eqn_il"><i>S</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>(<i>f</i>)</span> of normalized phase fluctuations or <span class="eqn_il"><i>S</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>(<i>f</i>)</span> of normalized frequency fluctuations, rather than of the phase or frequency excursions themselves, because these normalized fluctuations are what determines the precision and accuracy e.g. of a <a href="optical_clocks.html" title="optical clocks: time measurement devices based on optical frequency standards">clock</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Ambient Conditions</h2>
<div>
<p>Laser noise often depends on ambient conditions.
Therefore, it is obviously essential to know what are the ambient conditions for which certain <a href="laser_specifications.html" title="laser specifications: descriptions of essential properties of a laser system, such as performance parameters, dimensions, and operating conditions">specifications</a> apply.
In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it apply to constant room temperature, or for arbitrary temperature changes within the allowed range of operation temperatures?</li>
<li>Is it valid immediately after switching on the device, or only after a long warm-up time?</li>
<li>Is a vibration-free environment assumed?</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is particularly important for specifications of <a href="beam_pointing_fluctuations.html" title="beam pointing fluctuations: fluctuations of the propagation direction of a laser beam">beam pointing fluctuations</a>.</p>
<p>It is not easy to specify laser noise under the influence of ambient noise sources such as vibrations, since it is difficult to quantify these influences.
Also, their impact may strongly depend e.g. on the noise frequency: a mechanical setup may have some resonances, making the device very sensitive to vibrations at certain frequencies.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Common Problems</h2>
<div>
<p>For various reasons, correct noise specifications are often not achieved:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mathematical description of noise is sophisticated, and often not properly treated in physics or engineering courses.
As a result, nonsensical noise specifications are widespread in product data sheets and even in the scientific literature.</li>
<li>In <a href="laser_physics.html" title="laser physics: the field of physics dealing with phenomena in lasers">laser physics</a>, there is a variety of different types of noise, which are conceptually and physically related in non-obvious ways (example: optical <a href="phase_noise.html" title="phase noise: noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">phase noise</a> and <a href="timing_phase.html" title="timing phase: a phase reflecting timing deviations by relating them to the pulse period">timing phase noise</a> of <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>).
Therefore, physical insight is as essential as mathematical knowledge.</li>
<li>Noise measurements are subject to many non-trivial technical issues.
For example, detailed know-how on the inner workings of electronic spectrum analyzers is required for obtaining correct results from measurements with such devices.
A black-box treatment (using the device readings without knowing how they are generated) easily leads to wrong results, e.g. via inappropriate device settings or the failure to apply certain correction factors (e.g. for logarithmic averaging in the spectrum analyzer).</li>
</ul>
