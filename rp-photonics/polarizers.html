</header>
<p>A polarizer is a kind of <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">optical filter</a> where the light transmission depends strongly on the polarization state.
Normally, light with linear polarization in a certain direction is passed, and light polarized in an orthogonal direction is blocked: it may be absorbed or sent to a different direction.</p>
<p>One can also construct devices passing light with a certain circular polarization, usually using one or more quarter <a href="waveplates.html" title="waveplates: transparent plates with a defined amount of birefringence, used for modifying the polarization of light">waveplates</a> in conjunction with a linear polarizer.</p>
<p>Note that a polarizer can <em>not</em> convert any polarization of input light into the wanted polarization; this is physically not possible.
It can only remove light with the unwanted polarization.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Ideal versus Real Polarizers</h2>
<div>
<p>An ideal polarizer would have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light with the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; polarization state is passed completely (without any loss of <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>), whereas light with the other polarization direction is blocked completely.</li>
<li>The passed light has a <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">degree of polarization</a> of exactly 100&#37;, and its transverse electric field profile is not modified.</li>
<li>All this would work for arbitrary wavelengths and at arbitrarily high optical power levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, polarizers are not ideal.
In particular, they absorb or reflect some part of the <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>, and the absorbed part may lead to thermal effects such as beam distortions.
The performance depends very much on the used type of polarizer (see below).</p>
<p>When using a polarizer, the actual goal is not always exactly the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>In some applications, the essential aspect is to ensure that one output is linearly polarized (with a high <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">degree of polarization</a>), whereas it is not relevant what happens to the input light with the &ldquo;suppressed&rdquo; polarization state.</li>
<li>On other cases, one needs to separate different polarization components in order to use both.
Often, a high degree of polarization of both is desirable.</li>
<li>Polarizers are also used for combining two polarized beams into one output beam, which may be polarized or unpolarized.
(See the article on <a href="polarization_beam_combining.html" title="polarization beam combining: a technique for combining two polarized laser beams">polarization beam combining</a>.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Types of Optical Polarizers</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Absorptive Polarizers (= Dichroic Polarizers)</h3>
<div>
<p>For low-power applications, <em>Polaroid filters</em> (<em>polarizing sheets</em>, <em>sheet polarizers</em>) are often used.
These consist of a special doped plastic sheet (a polymer materials), which has been stretched in one direction, such that the polymer chains are more or less aligned along one axis.
Light a polarization direction along the chains is strongly absorbed, whereas the absorption is weak for light with a polarization direction perpendicular to these.
The polymer sheet is usually mounted in some solid holder, which may have marks indicating the direction of polarization for maximum transmission.</p>
<p>Similar sheets are used for <em>polarizing glasses</em> (also called <em>polarized glasses</em>).
In case of sunglasses, only vertically polarized light is transmitted.
This reduces glare from water surfaces, for example, as horizontally polarized light experiences stronger reflection at such surfaces.
In case of polarizing glasses for 3D viewing, one eye gets the vertical polarization and the other eye the horizontal one.
In this way, a 3D display can transmit separate images for the eyes.</p>
<p>Polymer sheet polarizers can be made quite large, and usually they are quite cheap.</p>
<p>A more modern type of absorptive polarizer is based on silver or copper nanoparticles embedded in a thin glass plate.
These <em>glass polarizers</em> are much more expensive and not available in very large sizes, but offer a substantial better performance in terms of polarization extinction ratio.
Laminated versions are mechanically more robust and cause lower wavefront distortions.</p>
<p>Absorptive filters can handle only quite limited <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> (have a low <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage threshold</a>), because the absorbed power is converted to heat, and the sheet can easily be damaged by overheating it.
In case of simple polymer sheet polarizers, an optical intensity of only 1&nbsp;W/cm<sup>2</sup> may already be critical.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Polarizing Beam Splitters Based on Birefringence</h3>
<div>
<p>Much higher optical powers can be handled by polarizers where light with the &ldquo;rejected&rdquo; polarization state is not absorbed but only sent to some other direction.
(If it needs to absorbed later on, a beam dump can stand much higher powers than an optical element.)
The most common type of polarizing beam splitters exploit <a href="birefringence.html" title="birefringence: the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a> of a transparent crystalline material such as quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>), calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), yttrium vanadate (YVO<sub>4</sub>), beta barium borate (BBO) or magnesium fluoride (MgF<sub>2</sub>).
Often, two pieces of such material with different orientations of the optical axis are cemented together (or joined with a small air space).
The device is often mounted in a polymer housing, which may also contain a beam dump for light with the rejected polarization direction.</p>
<p>Different physical principles of birefringent polarizers are used:</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:252px;">
<img src="img/glan_taylor_prism.png" alt="Glan&ndash;Taylor prism">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A Glan&ndash;Taylor prism. <a href="total_internal_reflection.html" title="total internal reflection: the phenomenon that light incident on the boundary between two transparent media is fully reflected if the light is coming from the optical more dense medium and the angle of incidence is sufficiently large">total internal reflection</a> occurs for the s polarization, whereas there is little reflection for p polarization due to operation close to Brewster's angle.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>In some types of polarizers, such as the <em>Nicol prism</em>, the <em>Glan&ndash;Thompson prism</em>, the <em>Glan&ndash;Taylor prism</em> and the <em>Glan&ndash;Foucault prism</em>, total internal reflection occurs for one polarization state, but not for the other, so that one obtains completely different beam directions for these outputs.</li>
<li>Other types of polarizers, such as the <em>Wollaston prism</em>, the <em>Nomarski prism</em>, the <em>Rochon prism</em> and the <em>Sénarmont prism</em>, only exploit somewhat different <a href="refraction.html" title="refraction: the change of the propagation direction when a wave comes from one medium into another one">refraction</a> angles due to birefringence, and not any reflection.
Here, the two output beams are less strongly separated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such birefringent crystalline polarizers differ in various respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>For true polarizing beam splitters such as the Wollaston prism, both output beams are completely polarized.
This is not the case for some other designs, such as the Glan-Thompson prism, the Glan-Foucault prism and the Glan-Taylor prism (even though these can be more or less optimized in that respect).
Note that for many applications only one output is used, so that this aspect is not always relevant.</li>
<li>For some designs (e.g., the Glan&ndash;Taylor prism, the Glan&ndash;Foucault prism, the Rochon prism and the Sénarmont prism), one of the involved rays is not deflected, i.e., continuous to propagate after the polarizers in the same direction as the incident beam.</li>
<li>Some designs work properly only for a narrow range of incidence angles, whereas others have a wider angular acceptance range.
For example, the Glan&ndash;laser prism is a variant of the Glan&ndash;Taylor prism which works only in a narrow range of angles (which is usually no problem when working with low-<a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">divergence</a> <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a>), but has lower optical losses and a higher <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage threshold</a>.</li>
<li>Those designs using a cement rather than an air gap tend to have lower <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage threshold</a>.</li>
<li>Many polarizers have <a href="anti_reflection_coatings.html" title="anti-reflection coatings: optical thin-film coatings for reducing reflections from surfaces">anti-reflection coatings</a>, which function well only in a limited wavelength range.</li>
<li>Some crystal materials such as BBO allow for operation at particularly short wavelengths in the <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="ultraviolet light: invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> spectral region, whereas others are well suited for infrared light.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for the use of many different designs of birefringent polarizer designs is that different applications can have quite different requirements on the polarizers, and no design can meet all requirements.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Thin-Film Polarizers</h3>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:215px;">
<img src="img/polarizing_plate.png" alt="polarizing plate">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
A thin-film plate polarizer.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are different kinds of <a href="thin_film_polarizers.html" title="thin-film polarizers: optical polarizers based on a multilayer dielectric coating"><em>thin-film polarizers</em></a>.
<em>Thin-film plate polarizers</em> (Figure&nbsp;2) consist of a <a href="dielectric_coatings.html" title="dielectric coatings: thin-film coatings made of transparent dielectric materials, e.g. for laser mirrors or anti-reflection coatings">dielectric coating</a> on some glass substrate.
(Note that the substrate does not need to be <a href="birefringence.html" title="birefringence: the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringent</a>.)
For non-normal incidence (in a certain range of incidence angles), the reflectivity of the coating can be strongly polarization-dependent.
It is possible to have the &ldquo;rejected&rdquo; beam at a deflection angle of 90&deg;, which is often convenient.
However, many thin-film plate polarizers are operated at Brewster's angle, so that no <a href="anti_reflection_coatings.html" title="anti-reflection coatings: optical thin-film coatings for reducing reflections from surfaces">anti-reflection coating</a> is required on one side.</p>
<p>There are <em>polarizing cube beam splitters</em> where the dielectric coating is applied to one 45&deg; <a href="prisms.html" title="prisms: transparent optical devices which refract or reflect light">prism</a> and another 45&deg; prism is cemented to the coating, such that overall one obtains a cube.</p>
<p>Note that they can work only in a limited wavelength range, since the <a href="interference.html" title="interference: a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> effects in the multilayer coating are of course wavelength-dependent.
However, operation in a range of few hundred nanometers is possible.</p>
<p>An advantage of thin-film polarizers is that they can be made with rather large dimensions, which is more difficult with crystalline (birefringent) polarizers.</p>
<p>The article on <a href="thin_film_polarizers.html" title="thin-film polarizers: optical polarizers based on a multilayer dielectric coating">thin-film polarizers</a> gives more details.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Wire Grid Polarizers</h3>
<div>
<p><em>Wire grid polarizers</em> are made by fabricating very narrow (sub-wavelength) metal stripes on a glass substrate (using a lithographic technique) or in a free-standing arrangement (for longer wavelengths).
Such devices reflect s-polarized light, while p-polarized light is transmitted.
They can be used at very high average power levels.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Essential Specifications for Polarizers</h2>
<div>
<p>The performance of a polarizer is characterized by various specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>The power losses for the transmitted polarization state should be as small as possible.
Instead of the loss, the throughput (e.g., 99.5&#37;) may be specified.
These are often limited by the performance of <a href="anti_reflection_coatings.html" title="anti-reflection coatings: optical thin-film coatings for reducing reflections from surfaces">anti-reflection coatings</a>.</li>
<li>The rejected polarization should be suppressed as much as possible.
The most common specification is the <em>polarization extinction ratio</em> (or <em>contrast ratio</em>), which is the ratio of minimum to maximum transmission.
Simple sheet polarizers may reach an extinction ratio of only 1:500, for example, whereas high-quality birefringent polarizers (for example, Glan&ndash;Taylor prisms) can reach 1:10<sup>6</sup>.
Instead of the extinction ratio, the extinction itself may be specified, which is the (small) fraction of the incident power which is transmitted for the rejected polarization state.
Note that the polarization extinction ratio can be very different between two outputs of a polarizer.
For example, for a polarizing cube it may be much lower for the reflected beam than for the transmitted beam.</li>
<li>There is a nominal wavelength range in which a polarizer works.
This is the range of wavelengths within which the other specifications (extinction ratio etc.) are met.
Laser line polarizers are usually <a href="thin_film_polarizers.html" title="thin-film polarizers: optical polarizers based on a multilayer dielectric coating">thin-film polarizers</a> which are optimized for a narrow wavelength range and offer a very high performance there.
On the other hand, there are broadband polarizers of thin-film type or based on birefringence.</li>
<li>There is also a limited angular range.
Some polarizing cubes, for example, offer a too narrow angular range (e.g., only 3&deg;) to be operated with substantially <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">divergent</a> light, but there is no problem using them with <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="collimated beams: laser beams with weak divergence">collimated laser beams</a>.
Other polarizer designs can have a much larger angular ranges of the order of 10&deg; or even more.
This holds particularly for dichroic glass polarizers and for wire grid polarizers.</li>
<li>Low wavefront distortions are essential in many applications, as otherwise the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> may be degraded in a polarizer.
Unlaminated dichroic polymer polarizers as well as wire grid polarizers can be problematic in this respect, whereas crystalline polarizers usually exhibit low wavefront distortions.</li>
<li>There is a maximum average power which a polarizer can handle.
For non-absorbing polarizers, this can be rather high, if the parasitic power losses are small.</li>
<li>Particularly for operation with intense laser <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a>, for example from a <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="Q-switched lasers: lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched laser</a>, the <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage threshold</a> can be important.
A large clear aperture is usually required for working at very high <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> levels.
Large apertures, however, normally imply substantially higher prices, particularly for crystal-based (birefringent) polarizers.
With <a href="thin_film_polarizers.html" title="thin-film polarizers: optical polarizers based on a multilayer dielectric coating">thin-film polarizers</a> as well as sheet polarizers, large dimensions are less of a problem.</li>
<li>Some geometric properties can also be important for applications.
Some designs have a length larger than the clear aperture, while others can be much thinner.
The angle at which the reflected polarization component leaves the device can also be important.
An angle of 45&deg; can be convenient; in some cases, a large enough angular separation is sufficient.</li>
<li>Another quantity of interest may be the introduced <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>, for example when <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> are transmitted through a long crystalline polarizer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a high performance of a polarizer is more difficult to achieve in extreme wavelength regions, in particular in the <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="ultraviolet light: invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> spectral region.</p>
<p>Selection of a polarizer for an application can be a relatively complex task, as many different aspects have to be taken into account.
The different requirements for different applications are also the reason why so many polarizer designs are in use.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications of Optical Polarizers</h2>
<div>
<p>Polarizers have many different applications.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polarizing sunglasses and photographic filters can help to suppress disturbing reflections of sunlight (glare) on water surfaces, for example, because that reflected light is partially polarized.</li>
<li>A polarizer within a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> can force the laser to emit linearly polarized light.
Here, a high polarization extinction ratio is usually not required; a simple <a href="brewster_plates.html" title="Brewster plates: coplanar plates inserted into beams at Brewster's angle">Brewster plate</a> is normally sufficient despite its weak extinction.</li>
<li>When a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> is already linearly polarized, but not with a high <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">degree of polarization</a>, that degree can be improved (and the exact polarization direction stabilized) by sending the beam through a polarizer with a high polarization extinction ratio.</li>
