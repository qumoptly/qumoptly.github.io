</header>
<p>Infrared light is light with a vacuum <a href="wavelength.html" title="wavelength: the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> longer than &asymp;&thinsp;700&ndash;800&nbsp;nm, the upper limit of the visible wavelength range.
That limit is not well-defined, as the <a href="responsivity.html" title="responsivity: photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> of the eye is reduced very gradually in that spectral region.
Although the responsivity e.g. at 700&nbsp;nm is already very low, even the light from some <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> at wavelengths beyond 750&nbsp;nm can be seen if that light is sufficiently intense.
Such light may be harmful for the eye even if it is not perceived as very bright.
The upper limit of the infrared spectral region in terms of wavelength is also not precisely defined; it is usually understood to be roughly 1&nbsp;mm.</p>
<p>Different definitions are used for distinguishing different infrared spectral regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>near-infrared</em> spectral region (also called IR-A) ranges from &asymp;&thinsp;700 to 1400&nbsp;nm.
<a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">Lasers</a> emitting in this wavelength region are particularly hazardous for the eye, as near-infrared light is transmitted and focused to the sensitive retina in the same way as visible light, while not triggering the protective blink reflex.
Adequate <a href="eye_protection.html" title="eye protection: the protection of eyes against laser hazards">eye protection</a> is then very important.</li>
<li>The <em>short-wavelength infrared</em> (SWIR, IR-B) extends from 1.4 to 3&nbsp;&mu;m.
This region is relatively <a href="eye_safe_lasers.html" title="eye-safe lasers: lasers emitting in a wavelength region with relatively low hazards for the human eye">eye-safe</a>, since such light is absorbed in the eye before it can reach the retina.
<a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a> for <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, for example, operate in that region.</li>
<li>The <em>mid-infrared</em> (mid-wavelength infrared, MWIR, IR-C) ranges from 3 to 8&nbsp;&mu;m.
The atmosphere exhibits strong absorption in parts of that region; there are many absorption lines e.g. of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O).
Many gases exhibit strong and characteristic mid-IR absorption lines, which makes this spectral region interesting for highly sensitive trace gas <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy: methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized">spectroscopy</a>.</li>
<li>The <em>long-wavelength infrared</em> (LWIR, IR-C) ranges from 8 to 15&nbsp;&mu;m, followed by the <em>far infrared</em> (FIR), which ranges to 1&nbsp;mm and is sometimes understood to start at 8&nbsp;&mu;m already.
This spectral region is used for thermal imaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, however, that the definitions of these terms vary substantially in the literature.</p>
<p>Most glasses are transparent for near-infrared light but are strongly absorbing for longer wavelengths, where <a href="photons.html" title="photons: quanta of light energy">photons</a> can be directly converted to <a href="phonons.html" title="phonons: quantized microscopic vibrations in solid media">phonons</a>.
For silica glass, as used e.g. for <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>, strong absorption occurs beyond &asymp;&thinsp;2&nbsp;&mu;m.</p>
<p>Infrared light is also called <em>heat radiation</em>, since thermal radiation from hot bodies is mostly within the infrared region.
Even at room temperature and below, bodies emit significant amounts of mid- and far-infrared light, which can be used for thermal imaging.
For example, infrared images of a heated house in winter can reveal leaks of heat (e.g. at windows, roofs, or poorly insulated walls behind radiators) and thus help to efficiently direct measures for improvement.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Sources for Infrared Radiation</h2>
<div>
<p>Most <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a>, for example <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="YAG lasers: lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG lasers</a>, many <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and the most powerful <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a>, emit near-infrared light.
There are comparatively few laser sources for the mid- and far-infrared spectral regions.
<a href="co2_lasers.html" title="CO<sub>2</sub> lasers: infrared lasers based on a gas mixture in which light is amplified by carbon dioxide molecules">CO<sub>2</sub> lasers</a> can emit at 10.6&nbsp;&mu;m and some other wavelengths in that region.
Typical problems with <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> for solid-state mid-IR lasers are the limited transparency range of the host crystal and the tendency for fast <a href="multi_phonon_transitions.html" title="multi-phonon transitions: transitions between electronic levels of atoms or ions in solid media, involving the emission of multiple phonons">multi-phonon transitions</a> bypassing the <a href="laser_transitions.html" title="laser transitions: optical transitions where stimulated emission is used to obtain optical amplification">laser transition</a>; crystal materials with very low phonon energies are required.
Cryogenic lead-salt lasers were in earlier years often used for mid-infrared spectroscopy, but are now rivaled by <a href="quantum_cascade_lasers.html" title="quantum cascade lasers: semiconductor lasers relying on intersubband transitions, normally emitting in the mid-infrared spectral region">quantum cascade lasers</a>, which partly even achieve continuous-wave operation at room temperature.
<a href="free_electron_lasers.html" title="free electron lasers: laser devices where light amplification occurs by interaction with fast electrons in an undulator">Free electron lasers</a> can be used as broadly tunable and very powerful sources of infrared light.</p>
<p>Infrared light can also be generated via <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="nonlinear frequency conversion: the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a>.
For example, mid-infrared light can be generated by <a href="sum_and_difference_frequency_generation.html" title="sum and difference frequency generation: nonlinear processes generating beams with the sum or difference of the frequencies of the input beams">difference frequency generation</a> in <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="nonlinear crystal materials: crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal materials</a>, or with <a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="optical parametric oscillators: coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">optical parametric oscillators</a>.
See also the article on <a href="mid_infrared_laser_sources.html" title="mid-infrared laser sources: light sources emitting mid-infrared radiation in the form of a laser-like beam">mid-infrared laser sources</a>.</p>
<p>Ordinary light bulbs emit substantially more infrared light than visible light; this is the essential reason for their very limited power conversion efficiency of the order of 5&ndash;10&#37;.
Sun light also has strong infrared components.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Detection of Infrared Light</h2>
<div>
<p>Many types of <a href="photodetectors.html" title="photodetectors: devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a> are suitable for detecting infrared light.
For example, <a href="photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes: semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a> based on semiconductors with a sufficiently small bandgap energy can be used.
However, detectors for e.g. the mid-infrared region require such a small bandgap energy that carriers can be excited not only by light, but also via thermal energy, because the <a href="photons.html" title="photons: quanta of light energy">photon</a> energy is not much larger than <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i><sub>B</sub><i>T</i></span> at room temperature.
Therefore, infrared detectors often have to be cooled to fairly low temperatures in order to increase their sensitivity.
The same holds for infrared cameras.</p>
<p>Particularly for near-infrared light, there are <a href="infrared_viewers.html" title="infrared viewers: instruments for observing scenes with infrared light"><em>infrared viewers</em></a>, where infrared light from some scenery is imaged onto an infrared-sensitive photocathode, and generated photoelectrons are accelerated with a high voltage to a fluorescent screen, which then displays the image e.g. in green color.
Such IR viewers are used e.g. in laser labs for tracking infrared <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a>.</p>
<p>Low-cost tools for visualizing infrared light are <a href="laser_viewing_cards.html" title="laser viewing cards: cards used for visualizing laser beams in non-visible spectral regions">laser viewing cards</a> which emit visible light (or change their color) when hits by infrared light.</p>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="spotlight_2009_10_1930d7.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
