<p>Diode bars are high-power <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="semiconductor lasers: lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a> (<a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a>), containing a one-dimensional array of <a href="broad_area_laser_diodes.html" title="broad area laser diodes: laser diodes with a strongly asymmetric shape of the emitting region">broad-area emitters</a>, or alternatively of subarrays containing 10&ndash;20 narrow stripes.
They typically contain between 20 and 50 emitters, each being e.g. 100&nbsp;&mu;m wide.
A typical commercial device has a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> length of the order of 1&nbsp;mm, is 10&nbsp;mm wide and generates tens of watts of output power or even up to &asymp;200&nbsp;W; some prototypes even reach several hundreds of watts (possibly with a reduced lifetime).
Within the last 20 years, the price per watt has come down by nearly two orders of magnitude, while at the same time the <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> (for a given power level) has been very significantly improved.</p>

</figure>
<p>Most diode bars operate in the wavelength region from 780 to 860&nbsp;nm or between 940 and 980&nbsp;nm, with the wavelengths of 808&nbsp;nm (for pumping <a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="neodymium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium</a> lasers) and 940&nbsp;nm (for pumping Yb:YAG) being most prominent.
Another important wavelength is 975&ndash;980&nbsp;nm for pumping <a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="erbium-doped gain media: laser gain media doped with erbium ions">erbium-doped</a> or <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="ytterbium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped</a> <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>A non-ideal property of diode bars is the spatial pattern of its emission.
In the &ldquo;fast axis&rdquo; direction (corresponding to the vertical direction in Figure&nbsp;1 and 2), the emission comes from a very narrow region, so that the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> is not far from <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a> (<a href="m2_factor.html" title="<i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor: a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a> not far above 1) despite the strong <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> angle of typically 30&ndash;40&deg; FWHM (full width at half-maximum).
On the other hand, the &ldquo;slow axis&rdquo; direction has a very wide emitting region, so that despite the much smaller divergence angle (of the order of 6&ndash;10&deg;) the beam quality is very poor, with the <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor &gt;&thinsp;1000.
Significant efforts are therefore often required for conditioning the output of a diode bar (or of multiple diode bars in the form of a <a href="diode_stacks.html" title="diode stacks: arrangements of multiple diode bars, delivering very high output power">diode stack</a>).</p>
<p>The large <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> (NA) of typically &asymp;&thinsp;0.6 for the fast axis requires high-NA aspherical <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a> for <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="collimated beams: laser beams with weak divergence">collimating the beams</a> while preserving the beam quality.
Microoptic <em>fast axis collimators</em>, containing an array of aspherical cylindrical lenses, are often used for that purpose.
There are also microoptic modules which serve as <em>slow axis collimators</em>.
The demands for slow axis collimation are lower concerning the NA of typically &asymp;&thinsp;0.1, but nevertheless not uncritical for diode bars with high fill factor (see below).
When beams with approximately circular <a href="beam_waist.html" title="beam waist: location with minimum beam radius">beam waist</a> and reasonable beam quality are required, a special <a href="beam_shapers.html" title="beam shapers: optical devices for modifying the shapes of laser beams">beam shaper</a> for symmetrization of the beam quality can be applied.</p>
<p>A potentially disturbing property of diode bars is the &ldquo;smile&rdquo; &ndash; a slight bend of the horizontal line connecting the emitters.
Smile errors can have detrimental effects on the ability to focus beams from diode bars.
There are some advanced beam conditioning schemes where the smile of individual diode bars is compensated.</p>
<p>The reason for the use of diode arrays instead of simply making very broad <a href="broad_area_laser_diodes.html" title="broad area laser diodes: laser diodes with a strongly asymmetric shape of the emitting region">single emitters</a> is that the latter would suffer from <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="amplified spontaneous emission: a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a> or <a href="parasitic_lasing.html" title="parasitic lasing: unwanted laser operation in a laser or amplifier device">parasitic lasing</a> in the transverse direction, or from the formation of filaments.
Diode arrays can be operated with a more stable mode profile, consisting of one so-called beamlet from each emitter.
There are several techniques which exploit some degree of coherent coupling of neighbored emitters, leading to better <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
Such techniques include those directly applied in the fabrication of the diode bars and others involving external <a href="cavities.html" title="cavities: resonators for light (or for microwaves)">cavities</a>.
Most diode bars, however, are used without such a technique.</p>
<p>Important design parameters of diode bars are the number of emitters, their width and spacing.
With respect to <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a>, it is ideal to get the output power from a small number of closely spaced emitters.
However, the <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical intensity: optical power per unit area">optical intensity</a> at the output facet is limited by the risk of catastrophic <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage</a> of the mirror coatings, and the output power is also limited by the active volume.
In addition, closely spaced emitters may be too difficult to cool, at least in <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="continuous-wave operation: operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave operation</a>; such diode bars are sometimes used only in <a href="quasi_continuous_wave_operation.html" title="quasi-continuous-wave operation: an operation mode of lasers (e.g. diode bars) where the pump power is switched on for short time intervals in order to limit thermal effects">quasi-continuous-wave operation</a> with not too long pump pulses.</p>
<p>Note that the array geometry makes diode bars very suitable for methods of <a href="coherent_beam_combining.html" title="coherent beam combining: a class of methods for beam combining, requiring mutual coherence of the combined beams">coherent</a> or <a href="spectral_beam_combining.html" title="spectral beam combining: a class of methods for beam combining, based on wavelength-sensitive beam combiners">spectral</a> <a href="beam_combining.html" title="beam combining: a class of techniques for power scaling of laser sources by combining the outputs of multiple devices">beam combining</a>, which make it possible to obtain a much higher beam quality.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Coupling</h2>
<div>
<p>Many diode bars are sold in <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled</a> form, because this often makes it much easier to utilize their output and also makes it possible to mount the diode bars with their cooling arrangement in some distance from the place where the light is used (e.g. a <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="diode-pumped lasers: solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped</a> <a href="laser_heads.html" title="laser heads: assemblies containing a mounted gain medium and means for pumping and cooling, or the complete optical parts of a laser, or assemblies for directing a laser beam to a workpiece">laser head</a>).
Usually, the light is coupled into a single <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fiber</a>, using either a simple fast-axis collimator and no beam conditioning in the slow-axis direction, or a more complex beam shaper to preserve the <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> better.
It is also possible to launch the beamlets from the emitters into a fiber bundle (with one fiber per emitter).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Cooling</h2>
<div>
<p>The semiconductor chip of a diode bar is soldered to a thin submount, which also gives one of the electrical connections.
An insulated wire bond plate provides the second connection.
The submount is then mounted on some heat sink, which is often water-cooled (with a macrochannel or microchannel cooler), allowing for a high <em>fill factor</em> (ratio of emitter width to total width of emitting region) of e.g. 80&#37; and thus for a high <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a>.
Conduction-cooled bars (often used with a thermoelectric cooler) have a lower fill factor of e.g. 30&#37;, because the heat can be extracted less efficiently.
In both cases, diode bars are often produced in sealed packages.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Power Efficiency</h2>
<div>
<p>Electrically, the different emitters are all connected in parallel.
This means that the overall drive current (to be delivered by the <a href="laser_diode_drivers.html" title="laser diode drivers: electronic current supplies for one or several laser diodes">laser diode driver</a>) is substantial, of the order of tens or even hundreds of amperes.
One obtains roughly 1&nbsp;W of optical output power per 1&nbsp;A of current; combined with the typical voltage drop of the order of 2&nbsp;V, this results in a power efficiency (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="wall-plug efficiency: total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system"><em>wall-plug efficiency</em></a>) of the order of 50&#37;.
Further developments are under way (e.g. in the context of the SHEDS program of <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/" rel="nofollow">DARPA</a>) to reach 80&#37;.
Crucial technological issues are to reduce the operating voltage by optimizing electrical contacts and layer structures, to reduce further the thermal impedance, and to improve methods for facet passivation, effectively allowing higher <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical intensity: optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a> without the risk of catastrophic damage.
Improved power efficiency reduces the total electrical power demands and also the demands on the cooling system, and further usually allows for higher <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a>.
Often it comes with the additional effect of reducing the price per watt of output power, which is already well below 30 US dollars.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Lifetime</h2>
<div>
<p>Under ideal conditions, diode bars can have lifetimes of many thousands of hours.
However, devices often fail long before the specified lifetime is reached.
This is not necessarily a consequence of faults in the production or the design, but can be caused by a variety of factors outside the control of the manufacturer, such as short voltage spikes caused by a defective or ill-designed diode laser driver (often during switching the device on or off), or by too high an operation temperature, which itself can be caused by too high a drive current or insufficient cooling.
Water cooling is usually fairly effective, but its effectiveness can be strongly compromised by corrosion, which can occur e.g. when the specifications for the chemical condition of the cooling water (particularly its ion content) are not met.
On the other hand, too strong cooling can cause problems via condensation, when the dew point is reached.
Obviously, the whole diode laser system has to be properly designed in order to exploit the full lifetime potential of the bars.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Emission Bandwidth</h2>
<div>
<p>The emission <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of a diode bar typically amounts to several nanometers, which can be more than desirable for pumping a <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state laser</a>.
In addition, there is typically a tolerance of several nanometers for the center wavelength.
A strongly reduced wavelength tolerance and emission bandwidth may be achieved with optical feedback, e.g. from a volume <a href="bragg_gratings.html" title="Bragg gratings: reflecting structures with a periodic refractive index modulation">Bragg grating</a>.
This can facilitate, e.g., the <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="diode-pumped lasers: solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">pumping of a solid-state bulk laser</a>.
Bandwidth and exact center wavelength can also be important for <a href="spectral_beam_combining.html" title="spectral beam combining: a class of methods for beam combining, based on wavelength-sensitive beam combiners">spectral beam combining</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>High-power diode bars are used e.g. in material processing (e.g. welding and certain surface treatments), in medical applications (e.g. photodynamic therapy, tattoo removal, laser surgery), or for pumping high-power <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> (<a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk</a> or <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>).
Diode bars are also developed further for military use as battlefield laser weapons.
In the future, they may also increasingly be applied in large-volume consumer products such as cars.</p>
<p>For very <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="high-power lasers: lasers emitting very high optical powers">high powers</a> (above roughly 100&nbsp;W), one uses <a href="diode_stacks.html" title="diode stacks: arrangements of multiple diode bars, delivering very high output power">diode stacks</a>, which are essential several diode bars stacked in the vertical direction.</p>

<h2>Business Disputes</h2>
<p>Occasionally, serious disputes arise, e.g. when a company purchases a laser from some supplier. Conflicting views may occur concerning questions as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the <a href="beam_qualitybf4a.html?banner=arbitration">beam quality</a> consistent with the somewhat vague specifications?</li>
<li>Is it normal that the laser pulses exhibit substantial <a href="timing_jitterbf4a.html?banner=arbitration">timing jitter</a>?</li>
<li>Should it be considered as acceptable that the laser stays within specifications only if its alignment is optimized quite often by the user?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mediation</h3>
<p>Going to court is usually the last thing you want to do &ndash; but how else to resolve a conflict?</p>
<p>Mediation is a much more attractive approach. Only, you need to find a mediator</p>
<ul>
<li>who fully understands the technical matters, and</li>
<li>who can be trusted to be impartial and fair.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="paschottabf4a.html?banner=arbitration">Dr. Paschotta</a> from RP Photonics offers such services. Your chance is to reach a fair resolution with far less time and money than at court.</p>
