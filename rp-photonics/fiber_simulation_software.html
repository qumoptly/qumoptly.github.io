<p>Many aspects of the operation of passive and active <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="fiber optics: optics based on optical fibers">fiber-optic</a> devices are relatively complex.
Therefore, numerical tools are required for analyzing various physical details.
The resulting understanding can be used for the optimization both of the design of fiber components and of their use.
In the following, an overview on different aspects is given which are often relevant for the development of active and passive fiber devices.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Calculation of Fiber Modes</h2>
<div>
<p>Of the many <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a> of fibers, the guided modes are of particular interest, as they are important e.g. for coupling light into a fiber and for the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> of the output.
The mode properties are determined by the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> profile of the fiber.
Properties of interest can be, for example,</p>
<ul>
<li class="ta_left">the shapes of the amplitude or intensity distribution of modes</li>
<li class="ta_left"><a href="mode_radius.html" title="mode radius: a measure of the transverse extent of a laser mode or laser beam">mode radii</a> and <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode areas</a></li>
<li class="ta_left">the overlap with the doped <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> in a <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fiber</a></li>
<li class="ta_left"><a href="effective_refractive_index.html" title="effective refractive index: a number quantifying the phase delay per unit length in a waveguide, relative to the phase delay in vacuum">effective refractive indices</a></li>
<li class="ta_left"><a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>, e.g. the <a href="group_velocity_dispersion.html" title="group velocity dispersion: the frequency dependence of the group velocity in a medium, or (quantitatively) the derivative of the inverse group velocity with respect to angular frequency">group velocity dispersion</a> versus <a href="wavelength.html" title="wavelength: the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> (calculated by differentiation of the frequency-dependent phase delay)</li>
<li class="ta_left"><a href="bend_losses.html" title="bend losses: propagation losses in an optical fiber (or other waveguide) caused by bending">bend losses</a> versus bend radius</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout blue">The complexity and computation time of a mode solver depends critically on the type of index profile.</aside>
<p>Most all-glass fibers have a radially symmetric refractive index profile and also exhibit only weak index contrasts, so that approximations for weakly guiding waveguides can be used.
Under these circumstances, the <a href="lp_modes.html" title="LP modes: linearly polarized modes of optical fibers with radially symmetric index profiles in the approximation of weak guidance">LP modes</a> of the fiber can be calculated with a <em>mode solver</em> based on relatively simple numerical methods.
This also means that the calculation can be rather fast &ndash; the complete guided mode properties can be calculated within a second on an ordinary PC, even if there are many such modes.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;1 shows an example for a <a href="few_mode_fibers.html" title="few-mode fibers: fibers supporting only few guided modes">few-mode fiber</a>, where the wavelength is varied.
While for the shortest wavelength (750&nbsp;nm) the fiber has modes with 6 different intensity profiles, more and more modes disappear for longer wavelengths, until the fiber is <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiberpower_modes5.gif" alt="fiber mode profiles">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Amplitude profiles of all guided fiber modes for a variable wavelength.
The diagram has been made with the software <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Mode solvers based on substantially more sophisticated algorithms are required for other cases, such as <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="polarization-maintaining fibers: specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining fibers</a> lacking radial symmetry, and in particular for <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="photonic crystal fibers: specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a>.
The latter also exhibit very strong index contrasts, i.e., the weakly guiding approximation can not be applied.
There are various numerical techniques, and generally the computation time is much longer than for the simple methods as normally used for all-glass fibers.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Numerical Beam Propagation</h2>
<div>
<p>Not in all situations, the calculation of fiber modes is both feasible and helpful.
For example, the mode calculation is very difficult and rather time-consuming for the pump claddings of some <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a> with irregular profile.
It also gives more detailed information than required (hundreds or thousands of detailed mode intensity profiles), while still not fully taking into account the effects of irregular fiber bends.
Another example is the behavior of fused <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber couplers: fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a>, where the modes strongly depend on the local conditions.
In such cases, it is often more suitable to numerical simulate the beam propagation.</p>
<p>As a first example, Figure&nbsp;2 shows how pump light gets absorbed in a double-clad fiber with a simple geometry: a circular core in the middle of a circular pump cladding.
Here, pump absorption is quite incomplete as some modes have very poor overlap with the doped core.
Such a beam propagation model can be easily applied to other geometries, e.g. with an off-centered core, a D-shaped or octagonal core, or with strong bending, which may even be variable along the fiber length.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiberpower_dcf1.png" alt="amplitude distribution along the fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Amplitude distribution of pump light along a double-clad fiber with a circular pump cladding.
This <a href="fiberpower_dcf.html">numerical simulation</a>, done with the software <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a>, shows that the pump intensity distribution develops a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; in the core region.
The remaining pump light exhibits quite incomplete absorption.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another example is a fused fiber coupler, where two cores come close together over some distance.
Their evanescent fields then touch each other, so that light can couple over.
The detailed behavior depends strongly on the gap size, the coupling distance, and the wavelength.
Figure&nbsp;3 shows a typical simulation.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Optical Amplification in Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>Optical amplification occurs in <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">amplifiers</a>, which are usually based on <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a>.
The dopant is usually restricted to the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>, but there are also modified designs for special applications e.g. with ring doping around the core.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Behavior of the Laser-active Ions</h3>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">Simple gain models are sufficient for many cases, but more sophisticated models are required in other situations.</aside>
<p>The interaction of the laser-active ions with the light field can usually be described with <a href="rate_equation_modeling.html" title="rate equation modeling: a method of modeling the dynamics of laser gain media">rate equation modeling</a>.
Differential equations describe the temporal evolution of the excitations of different levels for given optical intensities, and can also be used for calculating steady-state level populations.
In many cases (e.g., ytterbium-doped lasers and amplifiers), a simplified gain model, considering only a single metastable state and the ground state, is sufficient for an accurate description.
In other cases, however, a more sophisticated gain model needs to be set up, which may take into account multiple metastable levels and various processes which can shuffle ions between the different levels.
For example, there can be <a href="excited_state_absorption.html" title="excited-state absorption: absorption of light by ions or atoms in an excited electronic state, rather than in the electronic ground state">excited-state absorption</a>, <a href="quenching.html" title="quenching: the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> by <a href="upconversion.html" title="upconversion: a process where light can be emitted with photon energies higher than those of the light generating the excitation">upconversion</a> processes or <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="energy transfer: the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfers</a>, possibly even between different types of ions (e.g. in Er/Yb-doped fibers).
Ideally, a software allows the user to define arbitrary level schemes and all the relevant processes.</p>
<p>Various spectroscopic data are required for such modeling: effective <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="transition cross sections: material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">transition cross sections</a> (for ground-state absorption, excited-state absorption, emission), <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="upper-state lifetime: the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetimes</a>, <a href="quenching.html" title="quenching: the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> or <a href="upconversion.html" title="upconversion: a process where light can be emitted with photon energies higher than those of the light generating the excitation">upconversion</a> parameters, etc.
On the other hand, a computer model can be an essential tool for extracting such data from results of measurements.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Laser or Amplifier Gain</h3>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">The laser gain in a fiber also depends on mode properties.</aside>
<p>The resulting laser <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> depends on the excitation density of the laser-active ions, but also on the overlap of the fiber <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a> with the dopant.
Therefore, the gain does not only depend on the wavelength, but can also be different for different modes.
Fiber designs can be optimized such that higher-order modes experience a lower gain than the favored fundamental mode.</p>
<p>Note that the gain may be <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="gain saturation: the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">saturated</a> not only by an amplified signal, but also by <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="amplified spontaneous emission: a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a> (ASE).
Therefore, ASE has to be calculated as well, at least if the gain is relatively high.
(In models for fiber <em>lasers</em>, it can often be neglected.)</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Self-consistency in Fiber Lasers and Amplifiers</h3>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">Self-consistent steady-state solutions are sometimes very hard to find efficiently. A reliable and efficient algorithm is not easy to develop.</aside>
<p>For calculating the steady state of a <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber laser</a>, but also of a <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a> with counterpropagating pump and signal, one needs to find a self-consistent solution for both the excitation densities and the <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a>.
These quantities depend on each other, and neither one is originally known.
While relatively simple methods such as the shooting method can be used in simple cases, the task becomes numerically quite demanding in more complicated cases, e.g. when there is also strong <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="amplified spontaneous emission: a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a> (ASE).
Non-optimized algorithms can have serious problems with convergence and computation time when applied to difficult cases.</p>
<p>As an example, Figure&nbsp;4 shows the optical powers and the excitation density in an ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier.
Although this example is relatively simple, the behavior of the device would be hard to predict without numerical simulations, as substantial saturation effects from ASE arise, and the distribution of ASE powers depends in complicated ways on the ytterbium excitation profile.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Dynamic Simulations</h2>
<div>
<p>In various cases, not the steady state is of interest, but rather the temporal evolution for time-dependent power inputs.
As an example, one may consider a <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a> which is first pumped for some time, so that some energy is stored in the fiber, and then serves to amplify an injected nanosecond pulse.
During the pumping phase, the gain raises while the pump absorption decreases; the transmitted residual pump power may increase with time.
When the signal pulse is injected, it will saturate the gain, so that the temporal shape of the output pulse can become quite distorted.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;5 shows an example, where a signal input pulse with super-Gaussian temporal shape extracts much of the energy stored in an ytterbium-doped amplifier.
The dot-dashed curve shows how the output would evolve without <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="gain saturation: the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">gain saturation</a>.
Due to gain saturation, however, the gain drops during the amplification, and the output power gets lower.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/pulsed_amplifier.png" alt="pulse amplification in a fiber amplifier">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;5:</span> 
Output power and ytterbium excitation versus time in a pulsed fiber amplifier.
The diagram has been made with the software <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<aside class="callout blue">Propagation times of pulses are relevant in some cases &ndash; for example, in Q-switched fiber lasers.</aside>
<p>Another example is a <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q-switched</a> fiber laser.
Here, it is essential to take into account propagation times (which can often be neglected in amplifier models).
Lasing begins with ASE, which can be spatially quite variable due to the high gain which fiber devices typically have.
As a result, the generated output can exhibit complicated peak structures, which are not observed for Q-switched <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>.
Figure&nbsp;6 shows an example case, where a very fast Q-switch has been assumed.
For slower switching, one can obtain quite different pulse shapes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/qs_fl_time.png" alt="laser output versus time">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;6:</span> 
Output power and ytterbium excitation versus time in an actively Q-switched fiber laser, <a href="fiberpower_pamp.html">simulated</a> with the <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a> software.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that rather different time scales can be involved in a simulation.
Pumping can usually be simulated with rather course numerical time steps, whereas the generation of a Q-switched pulse requires much finer steps.
A software which can work only with a fixed step size would then be extremely time-consuming.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Ultrashort Pulse Propagation</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">Single-pass pulse propagation is not sufficient for many applications &ndash; one also needs multiple round trips, influences of other components, flexible inspection options, export of pulse details, etc.</aside>
<p><a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">Ultrashort pulses</a> can be amplified in a <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a> or generated in a <a href="mode_locked_fiber_lasers.html" title="mode-locked fiber lasers: ultrafast fiber lasers which are actively or passively mode-locked for generating ultrashort pulses">mode-locked fiber laser</a>.
Also, one may want to investigate pulse propagation in passive fibers, as used e.g. for delivery to an application.
For pulse propagation in the fiber, additional effects need to be taken into account &ndash; in particular, the <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> and the fiber's <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> (possibly including stimulated <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="Raman scattering: a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman scattering</a>).
In addition, it may be necessary to treat multiple fibers with different properties in a model and also effects of additional components, such as a <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="saturable absorbers: light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorber</a> for <a href="mode_locking.html" title="mode locking: a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode locking</a>, an <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">optical filter</a> or an <a href="output_couplers.html" title="output couplers: partially transparent laser mirrors, used for extracting output beams from laser resonators">output coupler</a>.
(With such features, a fiber simulation software also becomes usable for many bulk-optical devices.)</p>
<p>As an example, Figure&nbsp;7 shows how the optical spectrum of the output pulse of a similariton-type mode-locked fiber laser converges to a nearly rectangular shape within 100 resonator round-trips.
One also obtains the <a href="spectral_phase.html" title="spectral phase: the phase of the electric field in the frequency domain">spectral phase</a>, which is close to parabolic in the relevant region, so that dispersive <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="pulse compression: linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">pulse compression</a> is not difficult to do.</p>

<p>Generally, ultrashort pulse propagation is substantially more time-consuming to simulate, compared with simple propagation of powers for continuous-wave cases.
For finding the steady state e.g. for the amplification of high-repetition rate pulse trains, it is therefore much more efficient to first do a steady-state calculation and then refine the solution as required with ultrashort pulse propagation.</p>
<p>As the resulting processes can be rather complex, it is very desirable to have flexible tools both for arranging different model situations and for inspecting the results.
For example, it is useful to inspect the pulses at any location and after any number of round trips in the time and frequency domain, and to store pulses at specified locations for later analysis.</p>
