<p>The beam quality of a laser beam can be defined in different ways, but is normally understood as a measure of how tightly a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> can be focused under certain conditions (e.g. with a limited <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>).
The most common ways to quantify the beam quality are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="beam_parameter_product.html" title="beam parameter product: product of the beam radius in a focus and the far-field beam divergence">beam parameter product</a> (BPP), i.e., the product of <a href="beam_radius.html" title="beam radius: a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> at the <a href="beam_waist.html" title="beam waist: location with minimum beam radius">beam waist</a> with the far-field <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> angle</li>
<li>the <a href="m2_factor.html" title="<i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor: a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a>, defined as the <a href="beam_parameter_product.html" title="beam parameter product: product of the beam radius in a focus and the far-field beam divergence">beam parameter product</a> divided by the corresponding product for a <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a> <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="Gaussian beams: light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a> with the same <a href="wavelength.html" title="wavelength: the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a></li>
<li>the inverse <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor, which is high (ideally 1) for beams with high beam quality</li>
</ul>
<p>A high beam quality implies smooth wavefronts (i.e., strong <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> correlation across the beam profile), such that focusing the beam with a <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a> allows one to obtain a focus where the wavefronts are plane.
Scrambled wavefronts (see Figure&nbsp;1) make beam focusing more difficult, i.e., the beam divergence for a given spot size is increased.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/laser_beam2.png" alt="laser beam with poor beam quality">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A laser beam with poor beam quality.
The wavefronts are somewhat scrambled, which makes it more difficult to tightly focus the beam.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The highest possible beam quality in terms of <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> is achieved for a <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a> <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="Gaussian beams: light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a>, having <i>M</i><sup>2</sup>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.
That value is closely approached by many lasers, in particular by <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a> operating on a single transverse <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="resonator modes: modes of an optical or microwave resonator">mode</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="single_mode_operation.html" title="single-mode operation: operation of a laser on axial (longitudinal) resonator modes only, or even on a single axial mode"><em>single-mode operation</em></a>) and by <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> based on <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a>, also by some low-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> (particularly <a href="vertical_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers: a monolithic kind of semiconductor lasers with beam emission perpendicular to the wafer surface">VCSELs</a>).
On the other hand, in particular some <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="high-power lasers: lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power lasers</a> (e.g. solid-state bulk lasers and semiconductor lasers such as <a href="diode_bars.html" title="diode bars: a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a>) can have a very large <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> of more than 100 or even well above 1000.
In solid-state lasers, this is often a result of thermally induced wavefront distortions in the <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> and/or a mismatch of <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a> and pumped area in the <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a>, whereas in high-power semiconductor lasers the poor beam quality results from operation with a highly multimode <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a>.
In both cases, the poor beam quality is associated with the excitation of <a href="higher_order_modes.html" title="higher-order modes: transverse modes of a resonator or waveguide, excluding the fundamental (axial) modes">higher-order</a> <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="resonator modes: modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a>.</p>

</script>
<p>In the focus of a diffraction-limited beam (i.e., at the location where the beam radius reaches its minimum), the optical wavefronts are flat.
Any scrambling of the wavefronts, e.g. due to optical components with poor quality, spherical aberrations of <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a>, thermal effects in a <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>, diffraction at apertures, or by parasitic reflections, can spoil the beam quality.
For monochromatic beams, the beam quality could in principle be restored e.g. with a phase mask which exactly compensates the wavefront distortions, but this is usually difficult in practice, even in cases where the distortions are stationary.
A more flexible approach is to use adaptive optics in combination with a wavefront sensor.</p>
<p>It is possible to some extent to improve the beam quality of a laser beam with a non-resonant <a href="mode_cleaners.html" title="mode cleaners: devices which can improve the beam quality of laser beams">mode cleaner</a> or a <a href="mode_cleaner_cavities.html" title="mode cleaner cavities: optical cavities used as filters for improving the beam quality of laser beams">mode cleaner cavity</a>.
This, however, leads to some loss of <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> of a laser is determined by its output power together with its beam quality.</p>
<p>Note that the term <em>beam quality</em> is sometimes used with a qualitative meaning which has little to do with the focusability as discussed above.
For some applications, it is vital to obtain a smooth beam intensity profile, e.g. of Gaussian shape, whereas the beam divergence is not of interest.
The &ldquo;quality&rdquo; of a laser beam may then not be characterized e.g. with an <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> as discussed below: one beam may have a relatively small <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> value but a multi-peaked beam profile, whereas another beam may have a smooth beam shape but a high divergence and thus a large <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> value.</p>
<p>Some <a href="laser_applications.html" title="laser applications: applications involving laser devices">laser applications</a> such as lithography require the uniform illumination of a large area.
If the term beam quality appears in that context, it may have nothing to do with focusability as discussed in this article.
One may then even prefer beams with a rather low spatial and temporal coherence.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Measurement of Beam Quality</h2>
<div>
<p>According to ISO Standard 11146, the beam quality factor <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> can be calculated with a fitting procedure, applied to the measured evolution of the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="beam radius: a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> along the propagation direction (the so-called <em>caustic</em>, see Figure&nbsp;2).
For correct results, a number of rules have to be observed, e.g. concerning the exact definition of the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="beam radius: a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> and the placing of data points.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/caustic.png" alt="beam quality calculation from measured caustic">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Calculation of the beam quality from the measured caustic.
The black data points are those used for the fitting procedure, whereas the gray points are ignored.
(A balanced selection of data points, with some near the focus and others at a sufficient distance from it, is required according to ISO Standard 11146.)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are commercially available <a href="beam_profilers.html" title="beam profilers: devices for measuring the intensity profile of a laser beam">beam profilers</a> which can automatically perform beam quality measurements within a few seconds.
They are normally based on the measurement of the beam profile at different positions.
Beam profilers based on different measurement principles, e.g. CCD and CMOS cameras or rotating knife edges or slits, differ considerably in terms of the allowed ranges of beam radius and optical power, wavelength range, sensitivity to artifacts, etc.
For example, slit or knife-edge scanners can usually handle higher powers than cameras and can be precise for nearly Gaussian-shaped beams, whereas camera-based systems are usually more appropriate for complicated beam shapes.
Other issues come into play for beams with temporally varying powers, e.g. for the output of <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="Q-switched lasers: lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>.
It may then be necessary to synchronize a shutter with the laser pulses.</p>
<p>Instead of a moving a detector through the beam, one can use a spatial light modulator to avoid any moving parts [8].</p>
<p>Alternative measurement methods are based on the transmission through a <a href="mode_matching.html" title="mode matching: the precise spatial matching of the electric field distributions of laser beams and resonator modes or waveguide modes">mode-matched</a> passive <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="optical resonators: arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonator</a> or on wavefront sensors, e.g. Shack&ndash;Hartmann sensors.
The full characterization of the laser beam then only requires analysis in a single plane.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Importance of Beam Quality for Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>A high beam quality can be important e.g. when strong focusing of a beam is required.
In the area of laser material processing, printing, <a href="laser_marking.html" title="laser marking: a group of methods for labeling materials with lasers">marking</a>, cutting and drilling require high beam qualities, whereas welding and various kinds of surface treatment are less critical in this respect, because they work with larger spots, so that direct application of high-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> with poor beam quality is possible.
For cutting and remote welding, a relatively high beam quality (with <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> not much larger than 10) makes it possible to use a large working distance (i.e., a large distance between workpiece and focusing objective), which is highly desirable e.g. in order to protect the optics against debris and fumes.
Also, a high beam quality reduces the beam diameters in a beam delivery system, so that smaller and thus cheaper optical elements (e.g. <a href="mirrors.html" title="mirrors: devices which reflect light">mirrors</a> and <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a>) can be used.
Furthermore, the increased effective <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="Rayleigh length: the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a> (for a given spot size) increases the tolerance for longitudinal alignment.</p>
<p>A large working distance, made possible by a high beam quality, is also important for the design of <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="diode-pumped lasers: solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped lasers</a> when the pump beam has to go through various pieces of optics (e.g. a <a href="dichroic_mirrors.html" title="dichroic mirrors: mirrors with significantly different reflection or transmission properties at two different wavelengths">dichroic mirror</a>) before reaching the <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a>.</p>
<p>A very high (close to diffraction-limited) beam quality, associated with a high spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="coherence: a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>, is often required for <a href="interferometers.html" title="interferometers: optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometers</a>, optical data recording, <a href="laser_microscopy.html" title="laser microscopy: a technique for generating microscopic images by scanning objects with a laser">laser microscopy</a>, and the like.</p>
<p><a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">Mode-locked lasers</a> always have to have a high beam quality, since the excitation of higher-order transverse <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a> would disturb the pulse formation process.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Typical Beam Quality of Certain Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>Generally, the beam quality is not determined by the type of laser, but there are some typical trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most low-power <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="diode-pumped lasers: solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> exhibit a high (close to diffraction-limited) beam quality.</li>
<li>The same applies to various gas lasers such as <a href="helium_neon_lasers.html" title="helium&ndash;neon lasers: gas lasers based on a helium&ndash;neon mixture">helium&ndash;neon lasers</a> and <a href="co2_lasers.html" title="CO<sub>2</sub> lasers: infrared lasers based on a gas mixture in which light is amplified by carbon dioxide molecules">CO<sub>2</sub> lasers</a>.</li>
<li>Some <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="high-power lasers: lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> exhibit a poor beam quality, essentially because strong thermal effects in the <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> lead to beam distortions.
Also, there can be design trade-off between high beam quality and high power efficiency, or high beam quality and low <a href="alignment_sensitivity.html" title="alignment sensitivity: the sensitivity of a laser, an optical resonator or some other device with respect to misalignment">alignment sensitivity</a>.</li>
<li>Low-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> normally have a rather high beam quality, whereas high-power laser diodes basically always have a poor beam quality.
Essentially, this is because high powers require large emitting apertures which make the used <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a> highly multimode.
(The <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> cannot be strongly reduced.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="togglediv">Optimizing Laser Beam Quality</h2>
<div>
<p>Crucial factors for obtaining a high beam quality from a <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk laser</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>an optimized <a href="resonator_design.html" title="resonator design: the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">resonator design</a> with suitable mode area (particularly in the gain medium) and low sensitivity to <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="thermal lensing: a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a></li>
<li>good resonator alignment</li>
<li>minimized thermal effects, particularly from <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="thermal lensing: a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a> in the <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a></li>
<li>high-quality optical components (particularly concerning the gain medium)</li>
<li>an optimized pump intensity distribution (sometimes requiring a pump source with good beam quality) &ndash; more easily achieved with <a href="end_pumping.html" title="end pumping: a technique of optically pumping a laser medium in a direction along the laser beam">end pumping</a> than with <a href="side_pumping.html" title="side pumping: a technique of pumping a solid-state laser in directions which are approximately transverse to its beam direction">side pumping</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Beam Quality in Nonlinear Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>Beam quality is an issue not only for lasers, but also for <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="nonlinear frequency conversion: the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a>.
While <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="thermal lensing: a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a> in <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="nonlinear crystal materials: crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal materials</a> occurs only at very high average power levels (because heating occurs only through weak parasitic absorption), the beam quality can be affected by other effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="spatial_walk_off.html" title="spatial walk-off: the phenomenon that the intensity distribution of a beam in an anisotropic crystal drifts away from the direction of the wave vector">Spatial walk-off</a> can spatially shift the interacting beams, so that the overlap becomes weaker, and the interaction becomes spatially asymmetric.</li>
<li>For strong conversion e.g. in a <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="frequency doubling: the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doubler</a> or an <a href="optical_parametric_amplifiers.html" title="optical parametric amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on parametric nonlinear interactions">optical parametric amplifier</a>, there can be strong depletion of the pump beam near the beam axis or even backconversion, in extreme cases leading to pronounced ring structures.
<a href="gain_guiding.html" title="gain guiding: guiding of light based on spatially inhomogeneous optical gain">Gain guiding</a> can make such problems more severe.
Beam quality issues have been shown to limit the <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="power scaling of lasers: a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scalability</a> of high-gain nonlinear frequency conversion devices [5].</li>
<li>For <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>, the <a href="group_velocity_mismatch.html" title="group velocity mismatch: the phenomenon that pulses become temporally separated in a medium due to different group velocities, or (quantitatively) the difference of inverse group velocities">group velocity mismatch</a> and other effects can even lead to time-dependent beam quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, the use of a laser beam with poor beam quality in a nonlinear frequency conversion device can significantly spoil the conversion efficiency.</p>
<p>Beam quality effects in <a href="nonlinear_optics.html" title="nonlinear optics: the part of optics dealing with optical nonlinearities and their applications">nonlinear optics</a> can be investigated with numerical computer models, which can simulate the evolution of the spatial (and possibly temporal) profiles of the involved beams.</p>
