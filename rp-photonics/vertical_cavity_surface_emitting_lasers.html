</header>
<p>VCSELs are <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="semiconductor lasers: lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor lasers</a>, more specifically <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> with a monolithic <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>, where the emitted light leaves the device in a direction perpendicular to the chip surface.
The resonator (<a href="cavities.html" title="cavities: resonators for light (or for microwaves)">cavity</a>) is realized with two semiconductor <a href="bragg_mirrors.html" title="Bragg mirrors: mirror structures based on Bragg reflection at a period structure">Bragg mirrors</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="distributed_bragg_reflector_lasers.html" title="distributed Bragg reflector lasers: lasers containing distributed Bragg reflectors as end mirrors"><em>distributed Bragg reflector lasers</em></a>).
Between those, there is an active region (<a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain structure</a>) with (typically) several <a href="quantum_wells.html" title="quantum wells: thin layers confining carriers in one dimension">quantum wells</a> and a total thickness of only a few micrometers.
In most cases, the active region is electrically pumped with a few tens of milliwatts and generates an output power in the range from 0.5&ndash;5&nbsp;mW, or higher powers for multimode devices (see below).
The current is often applied through a ring electrode, through which the output beam can be extracted, and the current is confined to the region of the <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="resonator modes: modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator mode</a> using electrically conductive (doped) mirror layers with isolating material around them.</p>
<figure class="left" style="width:225px;">

</figure>
<p>VCSELs can have a good <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> only for fairly small mode areas (diameters of a few microns) and are thus limited in terms of output power.
For larger mode areas, the excitation of <a href="higher_order_modes.html" title="higher-order modes: transverse modes of a resonator or waveguide, excluding the fundamental (axial) modes">higher-order transverse modes</a> can not be avoided; this is a consequence of the extremely small resonator length of only a few microns, and the difficulty in homogeneously pumping a larger active region with a ring electrode.
The short resonator, however, also makes it easy to achieve <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="single-frequency operation: an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency operation</a>, even combined with some <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tunability</a>.
Also, VCSELs can be modulated with high frequencies, making them useful e.g. for <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> (see below).</p>
<p>In addition to the high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> of low-power VCSELs, an important aspect is the low <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>, compared with that of edge-emitting laser diodes, and the symmetric beam profile.
This makes it easy to <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="collimated beams: laser beams with weak divergence">collimate</a> the output beam with a simple <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a>, which does not have to have a very high <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>.</p>
<p>The most common emission wavelengths of VCSELs are in the range of 750&ndash;980&nbsp;nm (often around 850&nbsp;nm), as obtained with the GaAs/AlGaAs material system.
However, longer wavelengths of e.g. 1.3, 1.55 or even beyond 2&nbsp;&mu;m (as required for, e.g., gas sensing) can be obtained with dilute nitrides (GaInNAs quantum wells on GaAs) and from devices based on indium phosphide (InAlGaAsP on InP).</p>
<p>There are also optical <a href="amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers: devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifiers</a> which are very similar to VCSELs: they are basically VCSELs with reduced top mirror reflectivity.
See the article on <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="semiconductor optical amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifiers</a>.</p>
<p>An important practical advantage of VCSELs, as compared with <a href="edge_emitting_semiconductor_lasers.html" title="edge-emitting semiconductor lasers: semiconductor lasers emitting light along the plane of the wafer">edge-emitting semiconductor lasers</a>, is that they can be tested and characterized directly after growth, i.e. before the wafer is cleaved.
This makes it possible to identify quality problems early on, and to react immediately.
Furthermore, it is possible to combine a VCSEL wafer with an array of optical elements (e.g. collimation lenses) and then dice this composite wafer instead of mounting the optical elements individually for every VCSEL.
This allows for cheap mass production of laser products.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature of VCSELs is the long lifetime, as there is no facet which can be <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damaged by high optical intensities</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">VCSEL Arrays</h2>
<div>
<p>Much higher powers can be generated with <em>VCSEL arrays</em>.
A 2-D VCSEL array containing many thousand emitters (with a spacing of some tens of microns) can emit several tens of watts continuous-wave, thus competing with <a href="diode_bars.html" title="diode bars: a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a> and (combining multiple arrays) even with <a href="diode_stacks.html" title="diode stacks: arrangements of multiple diode bars, delivering very high output power">diode stacks</a> based on <a href="edge_emitting_semiconductor_lasers.html" title="edge-emitting semiconductor lasers: semiconductor lasers emitting light along the plane of the wafer">edge-emitting semiconductor lasers</a>.
VCSEL arrays can also generate such high output powers with a high <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="wall-plug efficiency: total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">wall-plug efficiency</a>.
The output power can simply be scaled up (&ldquo;<a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="power scaling of lasers: a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scaling</a>&rdquo;) by increasing the number of emitters.</p>
<p>The effective beam quality is of course much reduced (comparing with single VCSELs), as the emission comes from a much larger area while the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> equals that of a single emitter (which is smaller than for an edge-emitting laser but still substantial).
Note that emission from the VCSELs is usually not usually coherent; therefore, the intensities of the single emitters are simply added up.</p>
<p>Emission <a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> of VCSEL arrays can be very small, and the emission wavelength has a lower temperature dependence than that of a conventional laser diode.
This is  because the mission wavelength is essentially determined by a cavity resonance and not by the gain maximum, and cavity resonances have several times smaller temperature coefficients.
They are influenced only by the temperature dependence of the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> and not by carrier densities involving Fermi distributions.</p>
<p>Quite high <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak powers</a> are possible in pulsed operation with nanosecond to microsecond pulse durations.
Even in pulsed operation, the device reliability can be high: catastrophic optical damage (COD) can usually not occur due to the moderate optical intensities.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>VCSELs have many <a href="laser_applications.html" title="laser applications: applications involving laser devices">applications</a>, the most important of which are briefly discussed in the following.</p>
<p>Due to the short resonator round-trip time, VCSELs can be modulated with frequencies well in the gigahertz range.
This makes them useful as transmitters for <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>.
For short-range communications, 850-nm VCSELs are used in combination with <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>.
A data rate of e.g. 10&nbsp;Gbit/s can be reached over a distance of a few hundred meters.</p>
<p>An application area which was developed later, but has acquired a large market volume, is that of computer mice.
A laser mouse with a VCSEL as light source can have a high tracking precision combined with a low electricity consumption, as is important for battery-powered devices.</p>
<p>Another prominent field of application is gas sensing with <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength-tunable</a> VCSELs.
Such devices are built e.g. as MEMS VCSELs, having a separate <a href="output_couplers.html" title="output couplers: partially transparent laser mirrors, used for extracting output beams from laser resonators">output coupling mirror</a> the position of which can be tuned via thermal expansion, electrostatic forces, or a piezoelectric element.
In this area, VCSELs partially compete with <a href="distributed_feedback_lasers.html" title="distributed feedback lasers: lasers where the whole laser resonator consists of a periodic structure, in which Bragg reflection occurs">distributed feedback lasers</a> (DFB lasers), but offer a smaller drive current, a wider tuning range and a higher modulation speed.
Optical oxygen sensors are of particular importance, because an absorption line at 760&nbsp;nm is in reach of GaAs-based VCSELs, whereas longer-wavelength VCSELs which could be used for detecting water vapor, methane, or carbon dioxide need some further development before widespread use.</p>
<p>VCSELs can also be used in miniature <a href="optical_clocks.html" title="optical clocks: time measurement devices based on optical frequency standards">optical clocks</a>, where the laser beam probes an atomic transition in cesium vapor.
Such clocks could become part of compact GPS devices.</p>
<p>A more exotic, but nevertheless potentially important project is the <a href="thresholdless_lasers.html" title="thresholdless lasers: lasers with a threshold power which is virtually zero">thresholdless laser</a>.
VCSELs are interesting in this domain because they allow the utilization of quantum effects related to the modification of the mode density by the cavity.
With such a technique, a <a href="laser_threshold.html" title="laser threshold: an operation condition of a laser where laser emission just starts to occur">threshold</a> current of only 36&nbsp;&mu;A has been demonstrated [3].</p>
<p>Due to their high output powers, VCSEL arrays can often compete with diode bars (partially even with diode stacks), e.g. for pumping <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>.</p>
