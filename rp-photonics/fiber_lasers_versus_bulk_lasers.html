<p>It is natural to compare different <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> concepts with each other, in particular when they are used in overlapping application areas.
This is particularly the case for two different kinds of <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>: <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>.
There have been claims that fiber lasers, which have shown tremendous progress in recent years, will eventually replace most bulk lasers, since they could reach the same or better performance at a lower price.
However, it is then overlooked that they also face a number of challenges, and depending on the specific goals these may outweigh the advantages.
The outcome of such a comparison can thus depend strongly on various details of the specific requirements.</p>
<p>In recent years, global fiber lasers sales showed a significantly stronger growth than those of traditional solid-state lasers.
However, the total turnover from fiber lasers is still smaller than that of other solid-state lasers (as of 2014).
Their most important application areas are high-power laser material processing, <a href="laser_marking.html" title="laser marking: a group of methods for labeling materials with lasers">laser marking</a> and micro material processing.
Less important application areas are in the military domain, <a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="fiber-optic sensors: optical sensors based on fiber devices">fiber-optic sensors</a> and medical lasers.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Technical Challenges of Fiber and Bulk Laser Devices</h2>
<div>
<p>In the following, the most important aspects are briefly illuminated in order to permit a fair comparison of the concepts.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Basic Laser and Optical Properties</h3>
<div>
<p>The moderate gain and <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="pump absorption: the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> per unit length of <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a>, caused by limitations to the <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="doping concentration: the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a> in glasses, requires the use of relatively long gain media, which has various consequences, as discussed below.</p>
<p>The long length and small <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a> of fiber lasers lead to strong effects of the <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="Kerr effect: a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr nonlinearity</a>, despite the relatively small <a href="nonlinear_index.html" title="nonlinear index: a parameter for quantifying the Kerr nonlinearity of a medium">nonlinear index</a> of fused <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica</a> (the most popular glass material for fibers).
Particularly in the context of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulse</a> generation, but also for <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="single-frequency lasers: lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency lasers</a> and amplifiers, excessive nonlinearity can have very detrimental effects.
It often limits the achievable pulse duration or output power.</p>
<p>Most fiber lasers operate with high <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> and high <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> losses.
This makes them relatively immune to additional losses e.g. from various types of intracavity components.
For example, a fiber <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> may well contain a grating pair for wavelength tuning without the efficiency being degraded too much by the introduced resonator losses.
On the other hand, the small resonator losses of many bulk lasers make them interesting for <a href="intracavity_frequency_doubling.html" title="intracavity frequency doubling: frequency doubling with a nonlinear crystal within the laser resonator">intracavity frequency doubling</a> and can lead to lower <a href="phase_noise.html" title="phase noise: noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">phase noise</a>.</p>
<p>Many fiber devices are subject to problems with uncontrolled <a href="birefringence.html" title="birefringence: the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a>.
It is not only that this often changes the <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">polarization state</a> from linear to elliptical; these changes are unfortunately dependent on temperature and bending.
Many fiber lasers therefore may require readjustment of polarization controllers when the temperature changes.
This may be acceptable for laboratory use, but often not for commercial devices.
One does not always have the option to eliminate such problems by using <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="polarization-maintaining fibers: specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining fibers</a>, since special fibers and fiber devices are often not available in this form, and e.g. mode locking with <a href="nonlinear_polarization_rotation.html" title="nonlinear polarization rotation: the phenomenon that the change in the polarization direction of light in a fiber can depend on the optical intensity">nonlinear polarization rotation</a> would not work with a polarization-maintaining fiber.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Aspects Concerning High-power Devices</h3>
<div>
<p>Both fiber and bulk lasers can generate multi-kilowatt powers.
The power conversion efficiency (<a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="wall-plug efficiency: total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">wall-plug efficiency</a>) of fiber devices can be very high, and is often significantly better than that of bulk lasers.
On the other hand, fiber devices require pump sources with a higher <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a>, compared with pump diodes for bulk lasers, generally increasing the price per watt of the pump source.</p>
<p>The geometry of fibers and their built-in <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> effect essentially eliminate disturbing thermal effects (such as <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="thermal lensing: a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>) and thus make it possible to achieve an excellent <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> even at very <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high power</a> levels.
This is generally more difficult with bulk lasers, but some bulk laser concepts (in particular that of the <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="thin-disk lasers: solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk laser</a>) have the potential for even higher single-mode powers.</p>
<p>Nonlinearities can limit the performance of high-power fiber devices in various ways, particularly in the context of pulse generation.
A hard <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> limit in pulsed fiber devices is introduced by <a href="self_focusing.html" title="self-focusing: focusing of a beam in a transparent medium, caused by the beam itself through a nonlinear process in the medium">self-focusing</a>.
The <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="Raman scattering: a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman effect</a> is also strong in fibers and can be a limiting factor also for high-power continuous-wave fiber lasers.
In <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="single-frequency operation: an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency operation</a>, stimulated <a href="brillouin_scattering.html" title="Brillouin scattering: a nonlinear scattering effect involving acoustic phonons">Brillouin scattering</a> introduces severe limitations.
All these limits are generally much less severe for bulk laser devices, where nonlinearities can be weaker by orders of magnitude.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Short Pulse Generation</h3>
<div>
<p>Both fiber and bulk lasers can be <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q-switched</a> for generating nanosecond pulses.
The shortest pulse durations are usually achieved with bulk lasers, as the gain per unit length is smaller for fiber devices.
Also, fiber devices are limited in terms of peak power (see above).</p>
<p>High-power nanosecond laser systems based on fibers often contain some <a href="seed_lasers.html" title="seed lasers: lasers which are used for generating some seed light into an amplifier or another laser">seed laser</a> and a <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a>, allowing for very high average power while still being limited in terms of peak power.
In principle, very short seed pulses could be amplified, but the seed pulses often have to be made long enough to keep the peak power sufficiently low.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Ultrashort Pulse Generation</h3>
<div>
<p>Fiber lasers are based on <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped glass fibers</a>, which offer a high <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="gain bandwidth: the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">amplification bandwidth</a> compared with <a href="rare_earth_doped_gain_media.html" title="rare-earth-doped gain media: laser gain media which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped</a> <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a>.
The fiber format allows the use of glasses without suffering from their lower thermal conductivity (because of the geometry and the <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> effect) and their typically lower laser <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="transition cross sections: material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a> (because of the ease of obtaining a high <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> in a fiber).
As a result, fiber lasers can have very broad <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tunability</a> and can generate very <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">short optical pulses</a> via <a href="passive_mode_locking.html" title="passive mode locking: a technique of mode locking, based on a saturable absorber inside the laser resonator">passive mode locking</a>.
However, <a href="mode_locked_fiber_lasers.html" title="mode-locked fiber lasers: ultrafast fiber lasers which are actively or passively mode-locked for generating ultrashort pulses">mode-locked fiber lasers</a> often cannot utilize the full potential of the gain bandwidth in terms of <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="pulse duration: the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> because of the detrimental effects of excessive nonlinearities and higher-order <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>.</p>
<p>Fiber lasers can be <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked</a> using <a href="nonlinear_polarization_rotation.html" title="nonlinear polarization rotation: the phenomenon that the change in the polarization direction of light in a fiber can depend on the optical intensity">nonlinear polarization rotation</a>, which is an effective technique and less critical than <a href="additive_pulse_mode_locking.html" title="additive-pulse mode locking: a technique for mode locking a laser, using a nonlinear interaction in an external resonator">additive-pulse mode locking</a> of bulk lasers.
However, such lasers are usually not long-term stable due to thermal variations of the <a href="birefringence.html" title="birefringence: the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a> (see above).</p>
<p>For fiber lasers with high (multi-gigahertz) <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="pulse repetition rate: the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a>, one usually requires the technique of <a href="harmonic_mode_locking.html" title="harmonic mode locking: mode locking of a laser where multiple pulses are circulating in the laser resonator with equal temporal spacing">harmonic mode locking</a>, which makes the laser setup significantly more complicated than that of a compact bulk laser.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Sensitivity to Optical Feedback</h3>
<div>
<p>High-power fiber devices for material processing are often very sensitive to optical feedback.
One reason is that such devices are often <a href="master_oscillator_power_amplifier.html" title="master oscillator power amplifier: a laser system consisting of a seed laser and a laser amplifier for boosting the output power">master oscillator power amplifiers</a>, so that the backreflected light is even amplified on its way back to the seed laser.
In addition, the <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a> is fairly small, so that fiber ends are easily destroyed.
It is possible to use a <a href="faraday_isolators.html" title="Faraday isolators: optical isolators based on the Faraday effect">Faraday isolator</a> for preventing backreflected light from reaching the fiber, but this is not always practical, particularly at high power levels.</p>
<p>In many cases, one does not use an isolator, and then has to ensure that back-reflections are avoided e.g. by never allowing for normal incidence on a workpiece.
This, however, can restrict the flexibility and possibly the processing quality.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Robustness and Cost</h3>
<div>
<p>Simple fiber laser setups can be made from relatively cheap components, and they need fewer mechanical components.
Ideally, a fiber laser setup should be made with fibers only, not involving any air space.
Where this is possible, and processes such as <a href="fusion_splicing_of_fibers.html" title="fusion splicing of fibers: a technique of making low-loss fiber joints by fusing fiber ends together">fusion splicing</a> of fiber components can be largely automated, fiber lasers can be significantly cheaper and smaller than bulk lasers.
The output may then conveniently be delivered to a <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="fiber connectors: connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connector</a>, which allows easy connection to other devices without any alignment procedures.</p>
<p>However, the use of air spaces in fiber laser resonators often cannot be avoided, e.g. when certain bulk optical elements need to be inserted into the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>, or fibers with very different mode areas are used and <a href="tapered_fibers.html" title="tapered fibers: optical fibers which are over some length stretched out to a very small diameter">tapered fibers</a> for mode area adaptation are not available.
In such cases, the tight alignment tolerance of <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a> and sometimes the high <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical intensity: optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a> at fiber ends may make the setup less robust than that of a bulk laser, and the cost may also not be low.</p>
<p>Maintenance is often not required by fiber devices.
In the case of a defect, however, an all-fiber setup can make it relatively difficult to locate and exchange the defect part.
On the other hand, it is easy to exchange fiber-optic components if <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="fiber connectors: connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connectors</a> are used.</p>
<p>The cost for <a href="laser_development.html" title="laser development: the process of developing a laser device">developing</a> a fiber-based laser system is often higher (as discussed in a <a href="spotlight_2011_02_10.html">Photonics Spotlight article</a>), and the required time is longer.
This is partly because it can be difficult to procure special parts, and sometimes (particularly for <a href="ultrafast_lasers.html" title="ultrafast lasers: lasers emitting ultrashort pulses">ultrafast lasers</a>) because the operation principles of fiber lasers are more complicated than those of bulk lasers.
Also, it is easier to combine different components in a bulk-optical setup, or to insert or remove parts for diagnostic reasons.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Uncertainties in Parameters</h3>
<div>
<p>During the development of a laser system, difficulties can arise if relevant parameters of the gain medium are not known precisely.</p>
<p>For laser crystals as used in a bulk laser, there is a limited set of parameters such as <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="doping concentration: the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a>, spectroscopic data and geometric parameters.
For common crystal materials, the uncertainties are usually small, whereas spectroscopic data are often uncertain for less common materials.</p>
<p>For rare-earth-doped fibers, the situation is generally less satisfactory.
A first reason is that a fiber consists of glass material where the composition is less well defined.
Even the manufacturer may not know exactly the amount of germanate in the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> of a germanosilicate fiber, for example, and often the exact composition is not revealed to customers.
In addition, a fiber has additional parameters such as the core diameter or refractive index profile which can be uncertain and vary between different samples.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Some Guidelines</h2>
<div>
<p>Some general guidelines for determining in which areas fiber lasers or bulk lasers may be stronger are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiber lasers are suitable for generating very high average powers with high beam quality.
This holds particularly for unusual wavelengths, where no good bulk crystals or glasses are available.
Fiber lasers are clearly superior for difficult lasing schemes such as low-gain transitions or <a href="upconversion_lasers.html" title="upconversion lasers: lasers relying on upconversion processes">upconversion</a>.
However, bulk lasers are required for some other spectral regions; for example, there is no fiber laser to replace a broadly tunable <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers: lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">Ti:sapphire laser</a> in the region of 700&ndash;1000&nbsp;nm.</li>
<li>Bulk lasers have a higher potential for high <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="pulse energy: energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a> and <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak powers</a> either with <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a> or with <a href="mode_locking.html" title="mode locking: a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode locking</a>.</li>
<li>Bulk lasers can utilize pump sources with very poor beam quality.
In the most extreme case, a <a href="side_pumping.html" title="side pumping: a technique of pumping a solid-state laser in directions which are approximately transverse to its beam direction">side-pumped</a> <a href="rod_lasers.html" title="rod lasers: solid-state lasers with a rod-shaped gain medium">rod laser</a> can be pumped with <a href="lamp_pumped_lasers.html" title="lamp-pumped lasers: lasers which are pumped with flash lamps or arc lamps, or in rare cases with tungsten halogen lamps">discharge lamps</a>.
This can be advantageous e.g. when very high peak powers in pulses with moderate repetition rates are required.</li>
<li>Bulk lasers are often preferable when a stable linear polarization is required (and polarization-maintaining fibers can not be used for some reason).</li>
<li>For <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulse</a> generation, bulk lasers make it easier to achieve a high peak power and a high pulse quality in terms of smooth spectral shape, low chirp and low background.</li>
<li>In terms of fabrication cost, fiber lasers will often be superior for devices with low demands on peak power, polarization, emission bandwidth, pulse quality, etc.
However, more stringent demands of such type can often favor a bulk laser, as a fiber device would require complicated additional measures or very special parts.
Also, the often higher development cost of fiber-based devices can be a problem in cases with small sales numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The points discussed show clearly that both bulk and fiber lasers have significant advantages and disadvantages, so that one or the other concept can be superior depending on the particular circumstances.</p>
