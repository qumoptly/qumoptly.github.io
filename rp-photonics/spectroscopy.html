</header>
<p>The term spectroscopy denotes methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized.
Usually, the strength of some interaction is measured as a function of the <a href="wavelength.html" title="wavelength: the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> or <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="optical frequency: the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>; i.e., the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="optical spectrum: the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> plays an important role.</p>
<p>There exists a very wide range of very different spectroscopic methods; this article can give only a course overview.
Many of the modern spectroscopic methods involve one or several <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> and are then called <em>laser spectroscopy</em>.
Due to the enormous potentials of lasers in terms of temporal and spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="coherence: a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>, narrow <a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> and <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tunability</a>, <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> (particularly <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a>), <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulse</a> generation etc., the field of spectroscopy has been widened very substantially since the advent of lasers.
Even before that time, spectroscopy has delivered invaluable insight into many phenomena; for example, it allowed researchers to study the interior of the sun and discover helium there, even before it was found on earth.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Exploited Physical Effects</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Absorption of Light</h3>
<div>
<p>Different interactions between light and matter can be utilized in spectroscopy.
The most commonly used interaction is the absorption of light (&rarr;&nbsp;<em>absorption spectroscopy</em>).
For example, atoms and molecules exhibit distinct absorption features, so that different atoms or molecules can easily be distinguished if the absorption versus wavelength is measured.
Particularly in the mid-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="infrared light: invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> spectral region, molecules have relatively strong and narrow absorption lines related to their vibrational and rotational modes.
This allows one to detect a wide range of substances with a very high sensitivity.
An example for an application is the detection of tiny concentrations of air pollutants.</p>
<p>As molecules can have many different absorption lines, some of which may overlap for different species, detection of a single line is often not sufficient for discriminating between different molecules.
Recording the absorption spectrum for some sufficiently wide wavelength range, however, often results in a clear spectroscopic finger print.
One may also distinguish different isotopes.</p>
<p>The mid-infrared spectral region is quite ideal for sensitive spectroscopy e.g. of many gases, such as air pollutants.
Unfortunately, <a href="mid_infrared_laser_sources.html" title="mid-infrared laser sources: light sources emitting mid-infrared radiation in the form of a laser-like beam">mid-infrared laser sources</a> are typically less powerful and/or more complicated and expensive than near-infrared laser sources.
For example, one may apply <a href="sum_and_difference_frequency_generation.html" title="sum and difference frequency generation: nonlinear processes generating beams with the sum or difference of the frequencies of the input beams">difference frequency generation</a> in <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="nonlinear crystal materials: crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal materials</a>, requiring two input wavelengths and often leading to quite low <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a>.
Other challenges are that it is more difficult to obtain optical materials with high transmission at long wavelengths and also sensitive <a href="photodetectors.html" title="photodetectors: devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a>.
Therefore, one often exploits overtones, i.e., absorption lines at higher optical frequencies, corresponding to shorter wavelengths, where suitable laser sources are more easily realized and better photodetectors are available (in the extreme case, even for <a href="single_photon_counting.html" title="single photon counting: photodetection at low light levels where single photon absorption events are counted">single photon counting</a>).
However, such overtone absorption bands are weaker and thus often result in a lower sensitivity.</p>
<p>A low absorption coefficient can still allow for a high sensitivity if the pass length of light is increased accordingly.
Therefore, one uses <a href="multipass_gas_cells.html" title="multipass gas cells: a cell which allows to realize multiple passes of a laser beam through a gas">multipass gas cells</a>, where a long path length can be realized in a still relatively compact cell.
There are also resonant techniques, where one uses absorption inside a passive <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="optical resonators: arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonator</a> (e.g., <em>cavity ring-down spectroscopy</em>) or within the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> (<a href="intracavity_laser_absorption_spectroscopy.html" title="intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy: a method of laser spectroscopy, based on the evolution of the optical spectrum of intracavity radiation under the influence of narrowband absorption features"><em>intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy</em></a>).
In the latter case, one may e.g. use a broadband <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber laser</a>, where the output spectrum is detected for some time after applying a short pump pulse.
Even weak absorption features can lead to pronounced dips in the measured spectrum as that absorption applies in many subsequent resonator round-trips.</p>
<p>Spectroscopy is not only applied to microscopic particles, but also to macroscopic objects such as <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="optical resonators: arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonators</a>.
For example, a high-<a href="finesse.html" title="finesse: the free spectral range divided by the FWHM width of the resonances of an optical resonator">finesse</a> stable optical resonator can be used as an <a href="optical_frequency_standards.html" title="optical frequency standards: frequency standards using optical transitions in atoms, ions or molecules">optical frequency standard</a> and probed with spectroscopic methods.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Other Effects of Absorption</h3>
<div>
<p>Usually, the measured effect in spectroscopy is the reduction in <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> due to the absorption.
However, there are also other possibilities.
For example, in <em>photoacoustic spectroscopy</em> one exploits the generation of sound by absorption of light from a power-modulated source.
The absorbed light leads to some heating, which causes expansion of the gas and thus generates a sound wave, which can be detected with a sensitive microphone.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Emission or Scattering of Light</h3>
<div>
<p>Matter can also be exited to emit or scatter light with characteristic features.
This is already possible with simple heating or by illumination with sun light.
For example, a spectrometer on a satellite may record spectra of scattered light from the earth surface in order to distinguish rocks, plants, lake surfaces, etc.
Many advanced spectroscopic methods use the illumination of a sample with a <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> source.
An example is <a href="laser_induced_breakdown.html" title="laser-induced breakdown: a kind of spark, initiated by intense laser light"><em>laser-induced breakdown</em></a> <em>spectroscopy</em>, where one excites a sample with intense laser <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a> and detects light then emitted by the sample in the visible and/or infrared spectral region.</p>
<p>The absorbed light may not only lead to heating, but also excite atoms or molecules, which then subsequently emit <a href="fluorescence.html" title="fluorescence: luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> light.
One may record the spectrum of the emitted light and/or the strength of excitation as a function of the wavelength of the <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="optical pumping: electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">pump light</a>; both methods can lead to highly specific detection of certain substances or allow one to measure certain microscopic properties of materials.</p>
<p>An example for such methods is the investigation of laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain media</a>.
A <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> with suitable optical frequency can excite laser-active ions into <a href="metastable_states.html" title="metastable states: excited states (particularly electronic states in laser gain media) which have a relatively long lifetime due to slow radiative and non-radiative decay">metastable states</a>, from which they may be further excited (for sufficiently high optical intensities) or get back to the ground state, emitting fluorescence light.
The fluorescence spectrum is related to the wavelength-dependent emission <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="transition cross sections: material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross sections</a>, which are relevant for the achievable laser <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>.
One may also detect the decay of fluorescence intensity after excitation with a short laser <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulse</a> in order to determine the <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="upper-state lifetime: the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a>.
With a combination of spectroscopic techniques, one may achieve a comprehensive characterization of the physical details of laser gain media such as <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> or <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a> [8].
One may even study subtle effects such as interactions between different laser-active ions, leading to <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="energy transfer: the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfer</a> phenomena.</p>
<p>Another example is <em>Raman spectroscopy</em>, where a substance is irradiated with narrow-band light at a high optical power level, and one detects the weak emission of light with slightly longer wavelengths, which arises from spontaneous and/or stimulated <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="Raman scattering: a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman scattering</a>, a kind of inelastic scattering.
The spectrum of Raman-scattered light (which is separated from the pump light with a special narrow-band dichroic <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">optical filter</a> such as <a href="rugate_filters.html" title="rugate filters: dielectric interference filters with a continuous variation of the refractive index">Rugate filters</a>) contains information on molecular vibrations.</p>
<p>High-energy Lidar systems, as used e.g. in atmospheric research, allow remote spectroscopic measurements over large distances.
Here, one may e.g. exploit Doppler shifts of back-scattered light, which reveal longitudinal wind velocities.
A variety of methods has been developed which allow the remote measurement of many properties such as temperature, pressure, trace gas concentrations and cloud particle densities.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Phase Changes</h3>
<div>
<p>In some spectroscopic methods, one exploits changes of the <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">optical phase</a>.
Typically, an interaction of interest occurs in one arm of an <a href="interferometers.html" title="interferometers: optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometer</a>.
The resulting phase changes can be sensitively detected because they are turned into power changes at the interferometer output.
Phase changes resulting from absorption lines are also relevant in <em>frequency modulation spectroscopy</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Methods of Spectroscopy</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Spectral Decomposition of Transmitted Light</h3>
<div>
<p>One may use a broadband light source (<a href="white_light_sources.html" title="white light sources: light sources with very broad optical bandwidth"><em>white light source</em></a>) and then apply a spectral decomposition in the photodetection system.
Often, a high spectral sensitivity is obtained by combining the <a href="photodetectors.html" title="photodetectors: devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a> with some kind of monochromator.
A high-resolution <a href="spectrometers.html" title="spectrometers: devices for separating spectral components">spectrometer</a>, for example, allows measurements for many different narrow wavelength bins without precisely controlling a light source.
The measurement time may be long if each wavelength is treated separated and there are many narrow wavelength bins, but some spectrometers can simultaneously record many wavelengths, e.g. when they contain a CCD array instead of a single <a href="photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes: semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiode</a>.</p>
<p>A special way of obtaining spectral resolution is the use of an <a href="interferometers.html" title="interferometers: optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometer</a> where an arm length is scanned during the measurement.
With a narrow-band light source, that would result in a simple sinusoidal oscillation of the output power.
With a broadband source, however, one obtains a superposition of many different oscillations.
Using a Fourier transform, one can retrieve the spectrum.
(Interferometric <a href="wavemeters.html" title="wavemeters: devices for precise measurements of laser wavelengths">wavemeters</a> have a similar working principle.)
Such methods are called <em>Fourier transform spectroscopy</em>.
This is often applied in the infrared spectral region and then also called <em>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy</em> (= <em>FTIR spectroscopy</em>).
Many modern infrared spectrometers are based on such techniques.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Variation of the Source Wavelength</h3>
<div>
<p>In many cases, spectroscopy is done with a wavelength-tunable light source.
(Various such sources are discussed below.)
One may then, for example, measure the absorption of a sample as a function of the emission wavelength of the laser.
As it is more difficult to make a widely tunable narrow-band laser source, that technique often leads to a smaller tuning range &ndash; smaller than the range possible with a simple broadband light source.
However, the method offers superior resolution and also rapid data acquisition with low noise, as one can obtain a relatively strong detector signal.
Note that all available optical power is concentrated on a particular wavelength of interest, rather than spread over the whole measurement range.</p>
<p>As the optical power often somewhat varies with wavelength (and possibly also with time), a high precision requires monitoring of that power.
This can be done, for example, in two-beam spectrometers, where the light from the source is split into two beams.
Only one beam (the sample beam), but not the reference beam, is sent through the medium under investigation, and the powers or intensities of both beams are measured.
Particularly high sensitivities can be obtained with balanced photodetectors, where one directly measures the difference of photocurrents from the two beams.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Exploitation of Nonlinear Effects</h3>
<div>
<p>When high-intensity light sources (normally lasers) are used, one may exploit various <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear optical effects</a> for spectroscopy.
Raman spectroscopy has already been mentioned above.
<a href="two_photon_absorption.html" title="two-photon absorption: a nonlinear absorption process where two photons are simultaneously absorbed">Two-photon absorption</a> has been utilized for a long time [6].
Another important example is <em>coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy</em> (CARS), where two input waves generate a detected signal with slightly higher optical frequency via <a href="four_wave_mixing.html" title="four-wave mixing: an interaction of light waves based on a &chi;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinearity">four-wave mixing</a>.
Various other nonlinear effects, such as <a href="brillouin_scattering.html" title="Brillouin scattering: a nonlinear scattering effect involving acoustic phonons">Brillouin scattering</a>, can be exploited with other methods.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Elimination of Doppler Effects</h3>
<div>
<p>Atoms and molecules in gases can exhibit substantial <a href="doppler_broadening.html" title="Doppler broadening: broadening of the linewidth of atomic transitions, caused by random motion of the emitting atoms">Doppler broadening</a> of their absorption lines due to their thermal motion.
There are, however, various methods of <em>Doppler-free spectroscopy</em>.
For example, this can involve counterpropagating laser beams, where a probe beam in one direction selects a certain velocity class via absorption saturation [1], and the other beam detects that saturation.
This methods is called <em>Doppler-free saturation spectroscopy</em> [26].</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Terahertz Spectroscopy</h3>
<div>
<p>A relatively new field is terahertz spectroscopy [21], where terahertz radiation (with frequencies e.g. of hundreds of gigahertz to several terahertz) is used instead of light.
Although <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> cannot directly emit terahertz radiation, they can be used in different waves for generating such radiation, e.g. by using techniques of <a href="electro_optic_sampling.html" title="electro-optic sampling: an optical sampling technique based on the electro-optic effect">electro-optic sampling</a> or <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="nonlinear frequency conversion: the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a>.
Also, <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulse</a> lasers are useful for the time-resolved detection of terahertz waves.
As many optically opaque materials have a substantial transparency for terahertz radiation, terahertz spectroscopy can be used for a wide range of investigations in science and technology.
For example, it is now used for fault location in airplane parts and in security screenings.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Frequency Combs</h3>
<div>
<p>Some techniques of modern laser spectroscopy employ <a href="frequency_combs.html" title="frequency combs: optical spectra consisting of equidistant lines">frequency combs</a> as generated with <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a> [15].
As such a frequency comb contains some number of exactly equidistant lines in the spectrum, all of its frequency components are known (apart from some noise) if only two parameters are fixed (possibly stabilized with some feedback techniques): the comb spacing, which is related to the <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="pulse repetition rate: the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a>, and the <a href="carrier_envelope_offset.html" title="carrier&ndash;envelope offset: the offset between the optical phase and the maximum of the wave envelope of an optical pulse">carrier&ndash;envelope offset</a> frequency.
Therefore, frequency combs can serve for extremely precise frequency measurements in wide wavelength ranges, if they are produced with a high optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> (sometimes more than octave-spanning) and with proper frequency stabilization.
There are various important applications in <a href="frequency_metrology.html" title="frequency metrology: the field of technology dealing with precise frequency measurements">frequency metrology</a> (in particular, ultraprecise <a href="optical_clocks.html" title="optical clocks: time measurement devices based on optical frequency standards">optical clocks</a>) and other fields.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">High Temporal Resolution</h3>

<p>Spectroscopy may also involve measurements with an extremely high temporal resolution.
In <a href="pump_probe_measurements.html" title="pump&ndash;probe measurements: techniques for investigating ultrafast phenomena, where a pump pulse excites a sample and a probe pulse is used for probing the sample after an adjustable delay time"><em>pump&ndash;probe spectroscopy</em></a> one uses an <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort</a> pump pulse, followed by a probe pulse with a variable time delay between a few femtoseconds and several nanoseconds.
The effect of the pump pulse on the sample and thus on the probe pulse can be measured as a function of the time delay, which is often adjusted simply via a variable optical path length.
An alternative is to use to two mode-locked lasers with slightly different <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="pulse repetition rate: the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a>, so that a range of time delays is scanned continuously.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Lasers for Spectroscopy</h2>
<div>
<p>Due to the enormously wide range of methods for laser spectroscopy, there is also a wide range of different laser sources which are used for such purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="single-frequency operation: an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency</a> <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> can be used as cheap and compact wavelength-tunable sources.
The emission wavelength is often tuned simply by varying the drive current, which affects the temperature.
More refined schemes involve an external <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> containing wavelength-selective optical elements.
Such <a href="external_cavity_diode_lasers.html" title="external-cavity diode lasers: non-monolithic diode lasers where the laser cavity (resonator) is completed with external optical elements">external cavity diode lasers</a> allow for higher performance.</li>
<li>Some broadband tunable <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>, such as <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers: lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers</a>, chromium zinc selenide and sulfide lasers (Cr<sup>2+</sup>:ZnSe, Cr<sup>2+</sup>:ZnS, see <a href="chromium_doped_gain_media.html" title="chromium-doped gain media: laser gain media doped with chromium ions"><em>chromium-doped gain media</em></a>), Cr<sup>4+</sup>:MgSiO<sub>4</sub> (forsterite) lasers and <a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="erbium-doped gain media: laser gain media doped with erbium ions">erbium-doped</a> <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> can be quite useful for spectroscopy, as they can cover wavelength ranges of tens to hundreds of nanometers and often also provide a substantial output power and low noise.
In some cases, <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q-switched</a> operation with the generation of nanosecond <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a> is useful; important examples are <a href="laser_induced_breakdown.html" title="laser-induced breakdown: a kind of spark, initiated by intense laser light">laser-induced breakdown</a> spectroscopy and Lidar.
High <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="pulse energy: energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a> combined with a narrow <a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> (normally in <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="single-frequency operation: an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency operation</a>) are often of interest.</li>
<li>Fixed-wavelength <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> with relatively high power are used in Raman spectroscopy.
A <a href="narrow_linewidth_lasers.html" title="narrow-linewidth lasers: single-frequency lasers with a narrow optical emission spectrum">narrow linewidth</a> is important.</li>
<li>Mid-infrared radiation and terahertz radiation can be generated with <a href="quantum_cascade_lasers.html" title="quantum cascade lasers: semiconductor lasers relying on intersubband transitions, normally emitting in the mid-infrared spectral region">quantum cascade lasers</a>, often offering better performance and higher convenience than the previously often used lead salt lasers.
Very wide wavelength regions are accessible with such sources.</li>
<li><a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">Mode-locked lasers</a>, usually in the form of <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>, emitting trains of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>, are used for generating <a href="frequency_combs.html" title="frequency combs: optical spectra consisting of equidistant lines">frequency combs</a> (see above), often with highly stabilized optical frequencies.</li>
<li><a href="dye_lasers.html" title="dye lasers: lasers based on liquid or solid dyes as gain media">Dye lasers</a> can access broad wavelength regions, particularly in the visible spectral range, but also in the near ultraviolet and near infrared.
There are continuous-wave, pulsed and mode-locked versions.</li>
<li><a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="optical parametric oscillators: coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">Optical parametric oscillators</a>, pumped with various types of <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> in <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="continuous-wave operation: operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave operation</a>, with nanosecond, picosecond or femtosecond <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a>, can often be tuned in very wide wavelength regions, and can access spectral regions which are not directly accessible with lasers.
The extension to shorter wavelengths is possible with methods like <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="frequency doubling: the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doubling</a> and <a href="sum_and_difference_frequency_generation.html" title="sum and difference frequency generation: nonlinear processes generating beams with the sum or difference of the frequencies of the input beams">sum frequency generation</a>, whereas <a href="sum_and_difference_frequency_generation.html" title="sum and difference frequency generation: nonlinear processes generating beams with the sum or difference of the frequencies of the input beams">difference frequency generation</a> is a method for generating long-wavelength (often mid-infrared or even terahertz) radiation.</li>
<li><a href="supercontinuum_generation.html" title="supercontinuum generation: a nonlinear process for strong spectral broadening of light">Supercontinuum generation</a> can be used as a method to generate broadband light as required for some spectroscopic measurements.
This method can offer enormously broad spectra in combination with high spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="coherence: a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> and a significant optical power.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list of laser sources is not complete; even exotic types of lasers and nonlinear sources are sometimes used to meet certain requirements for spectroscopic applications.</p>
<p>A low level of <a href="laser_noise.html" title="laser noise: fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">laser noise</a> is often important for precision spectroscopy.
Various types of noise, such as <a href="intensity_noise.html" title="intensity noise: noise of the optical intensity or power of a laser beam">intensity noise</a>, <a href="phase_noise.html" title="phase noise: noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">phase noise</a> (related to a finite optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>) or <a href="timing_jitter.html" title="timing jitter: fluctuations of the temporal positions of pulses">timing jitter</a>, can be relevant.
More or less sophisticated schemes for the <a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="stabilization of lasers: measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities">stabilization of lasers</a> are therefore often employed.
These themselves often involve techniques of <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy: methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized">spectroscopy</a>, as far as frequency stabilization is concerned.
In extreme cases, a <a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> below 1&nbsp;Hz is achieved.</p>

<p><a href="laser_modelinge50a.html?banner=numerical_modeling">Numerical modeling</a> is often the most efficient way towards results:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand <em>quantitatively</em> what is going on</li>
<li>check the influence of design changes or possible detrimental effects</li>
<li>understand strange experimental observations</li>
<li>find optimized designs more reliably and faster</li>
</ul>
