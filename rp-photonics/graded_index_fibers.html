<p>Many <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a> are so-called <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="step-index fibers: optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index fibers</a>, where the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> is a function of the radial position, i.e., it is constant in some regions and exhibits steps (sharp changes) at certain locations.
However, there are also so-called <em>graded-index fibers</em> (or <em>gradient index fibers</em>), where the refractive index varies smoothly in the radial direction.
That can be achieved with <a href="fiber_fabrication.html" title="fiber fabrication: the fabrication of optical fibers">fiber fabrication</a> techniques where the chemical composition of the glass preform varies continuously.</p>
<p>A typical design of a graded-index fiber contains a parabolic profile from the fiber axis out to a certain radial position; outside that area, there can either be a constant refractive index (the cladding index) or first a depressed index region (trench).
Figure&nbsp;1 shows a simple design without such an index trench.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/graded_index_fiber1.png" alt="parabolic graded index profile">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Refractive index profile of a graded-index fiber, which is parabolic in the core region. The effective refractive indices of the guided modes (shown as gray lines) are approximately equally spaced. For this model, set up with the <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a> software, a parabolic profile for the GeO<sub>2</sub> concentration in a germanosilicate fiber has been assumed, which leads to an approximately parabolic index profile.
The fiber cladding is assumed to consist of pure silica (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Precisely speaking, what is meant to be parabolic is the <em>square</em> of the refractive index, i.e., the dielectric constant, rather than the refractive index itself.
This detail, however, is quantitatively not that important in most cases, since the refractive index contrast is typically quite small.</p>
<p>A remarkable feature of such parabolic index designs is that the <a href="effective_refractive_index.html" title="effective refractive index: a number quantifying the phase delay per unit length in a waveguide, relative to the phase delay in vacuum">effective refractive indexs</a> of the guided modes are equally spaced (only not precisely for the highest-order modes, &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; the outer region which deviates from the parabolic shape).
Figure&nbsp;2 shows the effective indices versus mode area; one can see that the effective index essentially depends on the mode index <span class="eqn_il"><i>l</i></span> only, but hardly on <span class="eqn_il"><i>m</i></span>.
(Note that many horizontal lines in Figure&nbsp;1 nearly coincide for that reason.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/graded_index_fiber4.png" alt="effective indices of parabolic profile fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Effective indices of the fiber versus <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a>, with the colors of the points depending on the mode index <span class="eqn_il"><i>l</i></span>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As shown in Figure&nbsp;3, the <a href="group_index.html" title="group index: the ratio of the vacuum velocity of light to the group velocity in a medium">group indexs</a> are approximately the same for all modes &ndash; except for the highest-order modes.
This shows that the <a href="intermodal_dispersion.html" title="intermodal dispersion: the phenomenon that the group velocity of light propagating in a waveguide structure depends on the waveguide mode">intermodal dispersion</a>, which can be characterized by the <a href="differential_mode_delay.html" title="differential mode delay: the range of time delay values for signals in a telecom fiber">differential mode delay</a>, is quite small &ndash; much smaller than for a <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="step-index fibers: optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index fiber</a>.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Of course, one can further tailor the refractive index profile, slightly deviating from a parabolic shape, in order to further optimize mode properties.
In particular, one may generalize the parabolic profile by using a different exponent; the higher that exponent, the closer the profile would be to a step-index profile.
An optimized profile exponent, deviating slightly from 2 (the value for parabolic profile), can be determined for fibers with high index contrast; the optimum value depends on the so-called profile dispersion parameter, describing the relation between <a href="group_index.html" title="group index: the ratio of the vacuum velocity of light to the group velocity in a medium">group index</a> and <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> for the chosen material composition.
For example, the results of Figure&nbsp;3, obtained for a parabolic profile, can be significantly enhanced further with a modified profile exponent of &asymp;1.85.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Intuitive &ldquo;explanations&rdquo; of the working principle of parabolic index fibers, based on oscillating arrays, may look convincing, but are actually quite crude!</aside>
<p>In an intuitive picture, one may consider hypothetical rays propagating along the fiber.
Such rays would perform sinusoidal oscillations around the fiber axis; the index gradient always &ldquo;bends&rdquo; them back towards the axis.
The strongly reduced intermodal dispersion is sometimes &ldquo;explained&rdquo; with the higher velocity of light away from the fiber core, which compensates the longer geometrical path length of the strongly oscillating ray, thus effectively leading to an effective path length per meter fiber which is the same for all rays.
This picture is rather crude, however; for example, it suggests that <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> delays acquired by the rays are strongly related to time delays, which is actually not true.
In fact, the strongly mode-dependent effective indices (see Figure&nbsp;2) show that the phase delays acquired by different modes are quite different, while the time delays are indeed quite similar according to Figure&nbsp;3.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;4 shows a simulation (with numerical beam propagation) where a Gaussian input beam has been somewhat displaced against the center of the fiber core.
In the fiber, the intensity profile oscillates without fully reaching the edges of the core region.
The observed oscillation is somewhat similar as in the ray picture mentioned above, but the perfect periodicity is destroyed by the cut-off parabolic shape.
Also note that the transverse size of the oscillating intensity peak varies substantially along the fiber.</p>

<p>For comparison, Figure&nbsp;5 shows the same for a step-index design with the same core radius and maximum refractive index.
The result looks quite different; one obtains a complicated evolution of the intensity profile.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Applications and Materials for Graded-index Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>The above example has been for a germanosilicate fiber, i.e., a glass fiber.
Similar designs, with typical core diameters being 50&nbsp;&mu;m and 62.5&nbsp;&mu;m, are used for multimode <a href="telecom_fibers.html" title="telecom fibers: optical fibers for use in optical fiber communications">telecom fibers</a> in <a href="fiber_optic_links.html" title="fiber-optic links: optical communication links where the signal light is transported in fibers">fiber-optic links</a> with a transmission distance of a few hundred meters, for example.
The fiber designs and high-precision fabrication techniques have been refined more and more for obtaining a minimum <a href="differential_mode_delay.html" title="differential mode delay: the range of time delay values for signals in a telecom fiber">differential mode delay</a>, in that way maximizing the <a href="modal_bandwidth.html" title="modal bandwidth: the maximum optical bandwidth (limited by intermodal dispersion) which can be used in a telecom fiber">modal bandwidth</a> and thus the transmission capacity of such links.
Early standards for named OM1 and OM2; the optimization later lead to OM3 and OM4 fibers, allowing for substantially higher performance.</p>
<p>Typically, a small differential group delay and thus a high modal bandwidth is achieved only in a relatively limited wavelength region e.g. around 850&nbsp;nm; the performance is already seriously degraded for a wavelength deviation of only 30&nbsp;nm, for example.
However, special <em>wideband multimode fibers</em> have been developed which offer relatively low intermodal dispersion over a broader wavelength range (e.g. 100&nbsp;&mu;m).</p>
<p>In the future, further substantially increases of transmission capacity may be achieved with mode division multiplexing, which can be realized with so-called <em>multiple input multiple output</em> (MIMO) techniques.
For certain practical reasons, it is then still important to achieve a rather small differential group delay.</p>
<p>Graded-index designs are also sometimes used with other types of glass fibers, e.g. for <a href="mid_infrared_fibers.html" title="mid-infrared fibers: optical fibers for use with mid-infrared light">mid-infrared fibers</a> [8].</p>
<p>There are also <a href="plastic_optical_fibers.html" title="plastic optical fibers: optical fibers made of polymer materials">plastic optical fibers</a> (POF) having graded index profiles.
They are often used in the same way, i.e., with the goal of minimizing intermodal dispersion effects in fiber-optic links.</p>
<p>Graded-index fibers are not only used for telecom purposes, but also e.g. for laser power transmission (<a href="power_over_fiber.html" title="power over fiber: delivery of power for electronic devices via light in an optical fiber">power over fiber</a>), where one may profit from the better output beam profile.
For such applications, fibers with much larger core diameters of e.g. 100, 200, 400 or even 600&nbsp;&mu;m are available.
Another application is using short pieces of such fibers as mode field adapters [12].
Some graded-index fibers are used in <a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="fiber-optic sensors: optical sensors based on fiber devices">fiber-optic sensors</a>, some are developed as <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fibers</a> [9], and there are even versions for guiding terahertz radiation [16].</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Graded-index Single-mode Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>Usually, the term <em>graded-index fibers</em> is used for multimode fibers only.
However, <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a> also often have a graded (but normally non-parabolic) refractive index profile.
This may sometimes just result from certain fabrication conditions, while in other cases it is actively tailored for obtaining certain mode properties &ndash; mostly concerning <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>.
For example, triangular, trapezoidal or Gaussian profiles, possibly equipped with additional features, are used for <a href="dispersion_shifted_fibers.html" title="dispersion-shifted fibers: fibers with a non-standard zero dispersion wavelength">dispersion-shifted fibers</a>.</p>
