<p>Double-clad fibers are an important technology in the area of active <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="fiber optics: optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a>, particularly for <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers</a>.
Only with double-clad fibers, very high output powers of fiber-based amplifiers and lasers are possible.</p>
<p>A <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber laser</a> or <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">amplifier</a> based on an ordinary doped <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a> can generate a <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a> output, but it restricts the pump sources to those with diffraction-limited <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and thus normally to those with low power.
On the other hand, the use of <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a> usually (although not always) leads to poor <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
However, a high beam quality is highly desirable for many applications.</p>
<p>This dilemma has been resolved with the invention of double-clad fiber designs, which allow <em>cladding pumping of fiber devices</em>.
Here, the <a href="laser_light.html" title="laser light: light generated with a laser device">laser light</a> propagates in a single-mode (or multimode) <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a>, which is surrounded by an <em>inner cladding</em> in which the pump light propagates.
Only the core (or sometimes a ring around the core) is <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped</a>.
The pump light is restricted to the inner cladding by an outer cladding with lower <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>, and also partly propagates in the single-mode core, where it can be absorbed by the laser-active ions.
The inner cladding has a significantly larger area (compared with that of the core) and typically a much higher <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>, so that it can support a large number of propagation modes, allowing the efficient launch of the output, e.g. of high-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> (e.g. <a href="beam_shapers.html" title="beam shapers: optical devices for modifying the shapes of laser beams">beam-shaped</a> high-power <a href="diode_bars.html" title="diode bars: a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a>), despite their poor <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.</p>

<img src="img/dcf.png" alt="cladding-pumped fiber amplifier">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Cladding-pumped fiber amplifier based on a double-clad fiber.
The signal light is launched into the doped core, while the pump light is launched into the inner cladding.
The core is D-shaped for more efficient <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="pump absorption: the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The pump light does not necessarily need to be injected into the fiber ends, as shown in Figure&nbsp;1.
It is also possible to use <a href="side_pumping.html" title="side pumping: a technique of pumping a solid-state laser in directions which are approximately transverse to its beam direction">side pumping</a> techniques, where access to the fiber ends is not required for pumping.
For example, coated V grooves cut into the inner cladding can be used to reflect pump light into the inner cladding.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Double-clad Fiber Designs</h2>
<div>
<p>There are a variety of different designs of double-clad fibers.
Figure&nbsp;2 shows the fiber cross-sections for the most important design types.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/dcf_designs.png" alt="double-clad fiber designs">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Various designs of double-clad fibers. The fiber core is shown in blue, the inner cladding in light gray, and the outer cladding in dark gray. An additional polymer coating, as often used, is not shown.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The simplest kind of design has a circular pump cladding and a centered core (first design in Figure&nbsp;2).
This is relatively easy to make and use, but in this kind of fibers there are propagation modes of the inner cladding (related to <em>helical rays</em>) which have hardly any overlap with the core, so that some significant part of the pump light exhibits incomplete <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="pump absorption: the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">absorption</a>.
As a result, the <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> and <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="wall-plug efficiency: total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">power efficiency</a> are compromised.
To a limited extent, this problem can be solved by strongly coiling the fiber.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiberpower_dcf1.png" alt="amplitude distribution along the fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
Amplitude distribution of pump light along a double-clad fiber with a circular pump cladding.
This <a href="fiberpower_dcf.html">numerical simulation</a>, done with the software <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a>, shows that the pump intensity distribution develops a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; in the core region.
The remaining pump light exhibits quite incomplete absorption.
With a D-shaped core, for example, this effect can be mitigated.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Modes with poor core overlap can be avoided by using a modified design with a lower symmetry.
Examples are designs with an off-centered core or a non-circular (e.g. elliptical, D-shaped or rectangular) inner cladding.
Such pump claddings are also often better matching the properties of pump sources such as <a href="beam_shapers.html" title="beam shapers: optical devices for modifying the shapes of laser beams">beam-shaped</a> <a href="diode_bars.html" title="diode bars: a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a>.
However, if the overall fiber (not only the cladding) has a non-circular shape, this may cause problems when <a href="fusion_splicing_of_fibers.html" title="fusion splicing of fibers: a technique of making low-loss fiber joints by fusing fiber ends together">fusion splicing</a> the fibers.</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:290px;">
<img src="img/dc_pcf.png" alt="air-clad photonic crystal fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span> 
Structure of a photonic crystal fiber with an air cladding.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Double-clad fibers can also be made as <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="photonic crystal fibers: specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a> as shown in Figure&nbsp;4.
Here, the multimode pump core is suspended by very thin struts in the air cladding, through which the pump light cannot escape.
Such a structure can have a very high numerical aperture of at least 0.6 for the pump light; this further reduces the requirements concerning the <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> of the pump source.
The thickness of the struts can be chosen such that at the same time one achieves good mechanical stability, high thermal conductivity, and minimal pump losses.
Another advantage of this type of fiber is that pump light is kept away from the protective polymer coating, avoiding any damage by absorbed pump light.
The guidance of the core is achieved as in other photonic crystal fibers.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Parameters and Fabrication Methods of Double-clad Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>Besides the properties of the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>, the ratio of the areas of inner cladding and core is an important parameter.
This area ratio should not be too large, because otherwise the effective <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="pump absorption: the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> length becomes large, and the pump intensity in the core is small, resulting in low excitation levels which can also compromise the power efficiency.
Area ratios of the order of 100&ndash;1000 are common.
Pump sources with improved <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> allow the use of fibers with a smaller area ratio, and thus also with a smaller length, which also reduces the impact of various types of <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>.</p>
<p>In many cases, the core and inner cladding of a double-clad fiber are similar to those of a normal core-pumped fiber, except that in addition there is the lower-index outer cladding.
If the inner cladding is made of <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica</a>, the outer cladding may consist of fluorine-doped silica.
The <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> for the inner cladding can then be e.g. &asymp;&thinsp;0.28.
Larger values are possible with polymer outer claddings, but these cannot tolerate very high temperatures and may introduce higher propagation losses for the pump light.
Therefore, all-glass designs are often preferred for high output powers.
Note that <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="photonic crystal fibers: specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fiber</a> designs such as that shown in Figures&nbsp;4 and 5 provide all-glass solutions with very high NA of the inner cladding.</p>

The design is similar to that shown in Figure&nbsp;4, but the core is rather large and <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="polarization-maintaining fibers: specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining</a> guidance is achieved with two stress rods.

</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>Double-clad fibers are extensively used for cladding-pumped <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers</a>.
Such devices can have a fairly high power <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="wall-plug efficiency: total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">conversion efficiency</a> (sometimes above 80&#37;) combined with a high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
As the beam quality of the output can be <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a> whereas that of the pump can be poor, the <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> of the laser or amplifier output can be much higher than that of the pump source.
Particularly if this increase in brightness is essential for an application, the cladding-pumped fiber laser may be called a <a href="brightness_converters.html" title="brightness converters: optically pumped devices where the generated optical output has a higher brightness than the optical pump source"><em>brightness converter</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Typical Problems with Double-clad Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>It has already been mentioned above that rather incomplete pump absorption can result from cladding modes with weak core overlap.
Even if strong mode mixing is ensured with a suitable design, the pump absorption is reduced according to the limited overlap of pump light with the doped fiber core.
Therefore, one typically requires an accordingly longer length of active fiber.
That can be detrimental e.g. in terms of fiber <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>.
Also, the larger total amount of dopant ions can make it more difficult to achieve laser or amplifier operation with short signal wavelengths, and the increased amount of fluorescent light can decrease the power conversion efficiency.</p>
<p>Some of the signal light may be coupled out of the core into the pump cladding, e.g. as a result of bending or by a <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg grating</a>.
That light will then remain in the pump cladding and will not (as for other fibers) get lost via the coating.
One may need some type of cladding light stripper (<em>cladding mode stripper</em>) to remove such light, if it would be disturbing in the device output.
That may also be the case for residual pump light.</p>

<p><input name="n" value="5" type="hidden"></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Does a saturable absorber as used for passive Q switching of a laser necessarily lead to a substantially reduced power efficiency?</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px; text-indent:-50px; text-align:left;"><input type="checkbox" name="answer_a" value="y"> (a) No, it doesn't. If its saturation energy is very low, not much energy is required to saturate the absorber.</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px; text-indent:-50px; text-align:left;"><input type="checkbox" name="answer_b" value="y"> (b) No, it doesn't, if one photon can saturate several absorber ions.</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px; text-indent:-50px; text-align:left;"><input type="checkbox" name="answer_c" value="y"> (c) Yes, the principle of using saturable absorption unavoidably degrades the efficiency, since the absorption must be similarly strong as the initial laser gain.</p>
