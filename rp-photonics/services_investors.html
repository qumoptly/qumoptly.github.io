<h1>Services for Investors and Funding Agencies</h1>
<p>While RP Photonics Consulting works mainly on technical issues of manufacturers, its services are also interesting for venture capital and funding agencies.</p>

<h2>Independent Assessment and Comparison of Technologies, Products, or Technical Approaches</h2>
<p>Commercial investors do not need to be told that significant investments of <b>venture capital</b> require a thorough evaluation of chances and risks (<b>due diligence</b>).
From RP Photonics Consulting GmbH you can obtain a competent and independent assessment of the applicant's claims, as far as they relate to technological issues.</p>
<p>For example, RP Photonics can check</p>
<ul>
<li>whether the development plans are scientifically and technically sound (feasibility, viability, etc.),</li>
<li>whether there are competing (possibly even superior) technologies, and whether the management is aware of those,</li>
<li>in which way the chosen approach distinguishes the company from its competitors, and how their achievements compare with the state of the art</li>
<li>whether the development is reasonably structured to ensure efficient processes (see e.g. the article on <a href="laser_development.html" title="laser development: the process of developing a laser device">laser development</a>)</li>
<li>and to what extent the team has the technical competence to implement the plan (or how this competence could be supported).</li>
</ul>
<p>For these purposes, RP Photonics can study documents such as business plans, proposals, R&thinsp;&amp;&thinsp;D plans, patents, etc., and compile the results in a well-written report.
As required, RP Photonics is prepared to visit the company in order to analyze presentations, to clarify details in discussions, and to have a look at production equipment.</p>
<p>In the case that a market study or a detailed assessment of intellectual property (including subtle legal issues) is required as a supplement to technological evaluation, RP Photonics can team up with a partner in order to incorporate such aspects as well.
Also RP Photonics can contact other specialists in order to clarify additional details.</p>
<p>Such services are required particularly by investors, who consider to engage in a high-tech company or to acquire it, and need due technical diligence as a part of risk management.
However, the services are also of interest for other companies intending to subcontract a development, to license a technology, or to set up some other kind of partnership.
The own management or the chief technology officer of a high-tech company may also desire to get an independent <b>second opinion</b> on a technological route before making far-reaching decisions.</p>
<p>Due diligence should also be an issue for <b>funding agencies</b>, spending tax payer's money on high-tech research and development.
A thorough and competent evaluation of research proposals is not a luxury, but rather indispensable for a responsible handling of tax payer's money.</p>
<p>In any case, a small fraction of the project cost is well invested to make sure that the money is spent on projects which are technically sound, innovative and well placed in the market.
<a href="paschotta.html">Dr. Rüdiger Paschotta</a> of RP Photonics Consulting has extensive experience with funding proposals and research contracts, and he has in several cases helped to avoid funding of poor projects by revealing serious flaws within just a few hours.</p>
<div id="schemes"></div>
<h2>Development of Funding Schemes</h2>
<p>It is a non-trivial task of funding agencies to develop sensible criteria for research funding.
A task force for such a project will need experienced experts such as Dr. Rüdiger Paschotta of RP Photonics Consulting.</p>
<div id="help"></div>
<h2>Helping Your Clients</h2>
<p>If you have done an investment into a high-tech company, and this company gets into trouble, you may want to suggest someone who might be able to help &hellip;</p>
<div id="postmortem"></div>
<h2>Post-Mortem Analysis</h2>
<p>Of course, you hope that you never get there.
You are using due diligence as a means to avoid it.
If it happens, however, it can be important for various reasons to analyze in hindsight what caused the failure of a project.
In particular, one can learn from mistakes provided that these are properly understood &ndash; without a natural bias arising e.g. from threatening damage claims and alike.
For that, you need an independent expert.</p>
<div id="needs"></div>
<h2>Your Needs Are What Counts</h2>
<p>For such services to be useful, it is vital that they are not only carried out in a technically competent manner, but also that the communication between partners with rather different backgrounds (e.g. financial vs. technical) works well.
RP Photonics begins such a cooperation with carefully checking what the actual needs of its partner are, in order then to find a package which addresses those.
Special care is taken for presenting the results of an evaluation in a way which is understood by non-technical personnel.
Advice is usually delivered in the form of carefully prepared reports, but telephone consultancies are also possible.
As required, an evaluation document can be complemented with a personal discussion for clarifying any remaining questions.</p>
