</header>
<p>It is often necessary to transform the light output from an <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">optical fiber</a> into a free-space <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="collimated beams: laser beams with weak divergence">collimated beam</a>.
In principle, a simple collimation <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a> (see Figure&nbsp;1) is sufficient for that purpose.
However, the fiber end has to be firmly fixed at a distance from the lens which is approximately equal to the <a href="focal_length.html" title="focal length: a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a>.
In practice, it is often convenient to do this with a <em>fiber collimator</em> (<em>fiber-optic collimator</em>).
There are two different basic types of such devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some can be directly attached to bare fibers.
This is the cheapest and most compact solution, but such a fiber collimator is more or less permanently attached to a fiber.</li>
<li>Other fiber collimators have a mechanical interface to a <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="fiber connectors: connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connector</a>, e.g. of FC or SMA type; they are not for use with bare fibers.
One can easily attach and remove such a collimator from a connectorized fiber.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same kind of device can also be used for launching light from a collimated beam into a fiber, or for fiber-to-fiber coupling: light from the first fiber is collimated with a fiber collimator and then focused into the second fiber by another collimator.
Basically, fiber connectors can be seen as the natural interface between fiber optics and free-space optics.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiber_collimation.png" alt="fiber collimation">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A lens can collimate the output from a fiber, or launch a collimated beam into the fiber.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another application is the combination with a back-reflecting mirror and some additional optical element.
For example, one may insert a <a href="faraday_rotators.html" title="Faraday rotators: devices which can rotate the polarization state of light, exploiting the Faraday effect">Faraday rotator</a> in order to obtain a fiberized Faraday mirror, or a quarter-<a href="waveplates.html" title="waveplates: transparent plates with a defined amount of birefringence, used for modifying the polarization of light">waveplate</a> for an effective half-waveplate reflector.
In other cases, one may be using some <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">optical filter</a> or a <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="saturable absorbers: light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorber</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Size of the Collimated Beam</h2>
<div>
<p>The <a href="beam_radius.html" title="beam radius: a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> of the obtained collimated beam depends on the circumstances.
In some cases, the beam diameter is as small as the fiber diameter, e.g. 125&nbsp;&mu;m; the <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="Rayleigh length: the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a> can then be less than 1&nbsp;cm.
In other cases, one needs beam diameters of several millimeters or even more.</p>
<p>For calculations, the simpler case is that of a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>.
Here, the beam radius can be calculated with fairly good accuracy using the following equation:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/w_coll.gif" width="194" height="45" alt="collimated beam radius"></div>
<p>This assumes that the beam profile of the fiber <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">mode</a> has an approximately <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="Gaussian beams: light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian</a> shape, so that we can apply the corresponding formula for the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> half-angle <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&theta;</span><sub>fiber</sub></span>.</p>
<p>It is also assumed that the distance between fiber end and lens is close to the <a href="focal_length.html" title="focal length: a measure of how strongly an optical system focuses or defocuses light">focal length</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>f</i></span> of the lens.
If the distance is too small, the beam will diverge, and for too large distances it converges to a focus at some distance.
It can be useful to get slightly into that latter regime, where a beam focus (with a beam diameter slightly below that at the collimator) is reached in a suitable working distance.
The longer the focal length, the less critical is the longitudinal positioning.</p>
<aside class="callout red">A smaller fiber mode size often leads to a <em>larger</em> collimated beam!</aside>
<p>Note that a smaller mode size of the fiber implies a <em>larger</em> beam divergence and thus a larger collimated beam for a given focal length.
This also means that a shorter wavelength, which usually leads to a smaller mode size, leads to a larger output beam.
This holds even more if the fiber gets into the multimode regime for sufficiently short wavelengths.
For such reasons, a visible pilot beam for an infrared beam, for example, may not accurately show the size of the infrared beam.
Also, the correct fiber positioning for collimation may depend on the wavelength, particularly if no <a href="achromatic_optics.html" title="achromatic optics: optical devices or setups with minimized chromatic aberrations">achromatic lens</a> (see below) is used.</p>
<p>For <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>, the beam divergence at the output (and thus the collimated beam size) depends on the launch conditions, and possibly even on the condition (e.g. bending) of the fiber.
Generally, the beam divergence angle will be larger than according to the estimate for the single-mode fiber &ndash; possibly even much larger.</p>
<p>Fiber-optic collimators are available for different collimated beam sizes, which simply means different values of the focal length.
Naturally, devices for larger collimated beams need to be both longer and larger in diameter.</p>
<p>Some fiber-optic collimators have adjustment screws for controlling the beam direction (by an integrated tilt adjustment) or possibly even for the fine longitudinal positioning (adjustment of focusing or working distance).
Others don't have such adjustment options, and one may position and align the whole collimator with additional opto-mechanics.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Used Types of Lenses</h2>
<div>
<p>Different kinds of <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a> can be used in collimators.
For standard <a href="telecom_fibers.html" title="telecom fibers: optical fibers for use in optical fiber communications">telecom fibers</a> and in fact many others, one mostly uses GRIN lenses (graded-index lenses), as these are relatively cheap and small.
However, they are less suitable for larger beam diameters, e.g. of more than a few millimeters.
In such cases, one tends to use conventional singlet or doublet lenses, which may be of spherical or sometimes aspheric type.
This is needed, for example, when a collimated beam needs to be transmitted over a large distance, such as in <a href="free_space_optical_communications.html" title="free-space optical communications: optical data transmission through free space, usually through air or vacuum">free-space optical communications</a>, where a long <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="Rayleigh length: the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a> is required.</p>
<p>Special requirements may lead to the use of special lenses.
For example, <a href="achromatic_optics.html" title="achromatic optics: optical devices or setups with minimized chromatic aberrations">achromatic doublet lenses</a> are used if beams with quite different wavelengths need to be handled, as otherwise proper collimation may not be achieved for all wavelengths.
Aspheric lenses may be used in cases with large beam divergence from the fiber in order to minimize beam aberrations.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Insertion Loss</h2>
<div>
<p>The <a href="insertion_loss.html" title="insertion loss: power losses due to insertion of a device">insertion loss</a> of a single fiber collimator can be pretty small &ndash; of the order of 0.2&nbsp;dB (i.e., a few percent) or even lower.
It depends on various factors, such as <a href="anti_reflection_coatings.html" title="anti-reflection coatings: optical thin-film coatings for reducing reflections from surfaces">anti-reflection coatings</a> and dirt on the lens.
It should not matter, however, whether a bare fiber or a connectorized fiber is used.</p>
<p>The insertion loss for a pair of collimators, as used for fiber-to-fiber coupling, may be substantially higher than the sum of insertion losses of the two devices.
Particularly for single-mode fibers, it is important to achieve good <a href="mode_matching.html" title="mode matching: the precise spatial matching of the electric field distributions of laser beams and resonator modes or waveguide modes">mode matching</a>.
Obviously, both collimators should have the same collimated beam size.
Depending on the exact longitudinal positioning of the fibers in the collimators, some non-zero distance between the collimators may be ideal.
This also allows one to insert additional optical elements, such as <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">optical filters</a> or <a href="polarizers.html" title="polarizers: optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizers</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Use with Angled Fiber Ends</h2>
<div>
<p>Angled fiber ends are often used to suppress back-reflections from the fiber end face into the core, i.e., to maximize the <a href="return_loss.html" title="return loss: a measure for how much reflected light is attenuated">return loss</a>.
Unfortunately, the angle leads to some deflection of the output beam.</p>
<p>For some fiber connectors with inclined fiber connection, this can be compensated by some tilt of the fiber fixture.
Otherwise, the beam from the fiber will hit the lens at some angle.
After the lens, the beam direction should nevertheless be in the direction of the fiber (assuming correct longitudinal and transverse positioning), but it will be somewhat offset from the center of the lens.
That may also lead to increased insertion loss and to <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> deterioration if some clipping, reflection or scattering occurs at the edge.</p>
