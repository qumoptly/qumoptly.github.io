<a href="photons.html" title="photons: quanta of light energy">Photons</a> of the pump wave are then converted into (lower-energy) signal photons and the same number of so-called idler photons; the <a href="photons.html" title="photons: quanta of light energy">photon energy</a> of the idler wave is the difference between the photon energies of pump and signal wave.
As the pump energy is fully converted into energy of signal and idler beams, the crystal material is not heated in this process.</p>

<p>In the usual non-degenerate case, signal and idler waves constitute physically separate beams.
However, there are degenerate parametric amplifiers where signal and idler wave are identical, i.e. have the same frequency and same polarization.
The signal frequency then has to be exactly half the pump frequency, and the phase relationship between signal and pump determines the direction of energy flow, i.e., whether there is amplification or deamplification of the signal.
This phase-sensitive amplification does <em>not</em> occur in a non-degenerate amplifier; here, a signal with arbitrary phase can be amplified, and the phase of the generated idler will automatically adjust accordingly.
(More details are given in the article on <a href="parametric_amplification.html" title="parametric amplification: a process of optical amplification based on a parametric nonlinearity">parametric amplification</a>.)</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Phase Matching</h2>
<div>
<p>Parametric processes are sensitive to the <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">optical phases</a> of the waves involved.
Efficient conversion usually requires <a href="phase_matching.html" title="phase matching: a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase matching</a> to be arranged for the wavelength range of interest.
The <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="gain bandwidth: the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a> is largely determined by the <a href="phase_matching_bandwidth.html" title="phase-matching bandwidth: the width of an optical frequency range in which some process (e.g. a nonlinear interaction) can be efficient due to more or less precise phase matching">phase-matching bandwidth</a>, which depends on the <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> properties and can in certain situations be extremely large.</p>
<p>Parametric amplifiers are particularly attractive for the generation of wavelengths which are very hard to access directly with <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> and laser <a href="amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers: devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifiers</a> due to the lack of suitable gain media, or when properties such as a large tuning range or a high gain in a short length are required.
Tuning in a very wide wavelength range is often achieved simply by rotating the <a href="critical_phase_matching.html" title="critical phase matching: phase matching of a nonlinear interaction by adjustment of a propagation direction">critically phase-matched</a> nonlinear crystal.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Pulsed Operation</h2>
<div>
<p>In most cases, parametric amplifiers are used for <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a>, which may be nanosecond pulses from <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="Q-switched lasers: lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a> or <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> from <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>.
With the high pump intensities achievable with pulses, the parametric gain can be very high &ndash; sometimes more than 80&nbsp;<a href="decibel.html" title="decibel: a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">dB</a> within a few millimeters of crystal material.
This high gain, together with the potential to operate at very different wavelengths and the minimal heating (only due to parasitic absorption, which is usually very weak), makes parametric amplifiers very attractive for a range of applications, including <a href="optical_parametric_chirped_pulse_amplification.html" title="optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification: parametric amplification of chirped ultrashort pulses">optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification</a> of femtosecond pulses.
Due to the high gain, the effect of <a href="gain_guiding.html" title="gain guiding: guiding of light based on spatially inhomogeneous optical gain">gain guiding</a> must be considered in numerical models.
Purely analytical models usually neglect this effect.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">High-power Operation</h2>
<div>
<p>Generally, parametric amplifiers are suitable for fairly high output powers, but there are some partly non-trivial issues to observe.</p>
<p>A very beneficial property of optical parametric amplifiers is that fundamentally there is not dissipative process in the nonlinear crystal, so that thermal effects could in principle be entirely absent.
However, there are some parasitic absorption losses, the strength of which depends very much on the <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="nonlinear crystal materials: crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">crystal material</a>.
Unfortunately, even a moderate amount of local heating can be detrimental as it disturbs the <a href="phase_matching.html" title="phase matching: a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase matching</a>.
Therefore, significant thermal effects can in practice seriously limit the output power capability of a parametric amplifier.
This holds for, e.g., amplifiers based on KTP and KTA, whereas LBO shows only weak absorption.</p>
<p>Another issue, which is less well known, is <a href="gain_guiding.html" title="gain guiding: guiding of light based on spatially inhomogeneous optical gain">gain guiding</a>.
In an amplifier with high <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, the effect of gain guiding can strongly influence the output profile of the amplified wave.
This creates a problem for devices with large mode areas [9]: the signal beam becomes smaller and smaller, even if the input signal beam is large.
In the last section of the amplifier, where significant power is transferred from the pump beam to the signal beam, the signal beam is then too small to utilize the pump energy fully.
This problem does not occur for devices with small mode area, as diffraction counteracts the effect of gain guiding, but high-power devices require larger mode areas.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that gain guiding spoils the apparent <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="power scaling of lasers: a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scalability</a> of OPAs [9], even in the absence of parasitic losses: with the apparent power scaling procedure of increasing the mode area in proportion to the power level, one would run into the explained problem with gain guiding, so that one would have to sacrifice the output beam quality and/or the conversion efficiency.
Interestingly, the compromise between these performance figures can be improved by using a material with lower nonlinearity, operating with correspondingly smaller mode area.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Comparison with Laser Amplifiers</h2>
<div>
<p>The following list summarizes the most important differences of parametric amplifiers as compared with laser <a href="amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers: devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifiers</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric amplifiers are not limited to narrow wavelength ranges as defined by <a href="laser_transitions.html" title="laser transitions: optical transitions where stimulated emission is used to obtain optical amplification">laser transitions</a> of laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain media</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="gain bandwidth: the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a> is determined by the <a href="dispersion.html" title="dispersion: the dependence of the phase velocity in a medium on the optical frequency or the propagation mode">dispersive properties</a> and the length of the amplifier crystal, rather than by details of a laser transition.</li>
<li>With pulsed pumping, the gain per unit length can be much higher than for laser gain.</li>
<li>A parametric amplifier has no energy storage, i.e., it amplifies only while being pumped.
This allows for, e.g., very high intensity contrast between an amplified pulse and any satellite pulses.</li>
<li>The absence of heat generation (at least provided that parasitic absorption losses are small) makes OPAs suitable for high-power operation.</li>
<li>In the (rarely used) case of degenerate parametric amplification, the amplification is phase-sensitive, and <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="quantum noise: noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum excess noise</a> can be avoided.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber-optic Parametric Amplifiers</h2>
<div>
<p>There are also <em>fiber-optic parametric amplifiers</em>, which are based on the <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&chi;</span><sup>(3)</sup></span> nonlinearity of a <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>, rather than the <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&chi;</span><sup>(2)</sup></span> nonlinearity of a crystal, and often contain a fiber loop.
In that case, there can be up to four waves interacting with each other (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="four_wave_mixing.html" title="four-wave mixing: an interaction of light waves based on a &chi;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinearity"><em>four-wave mixing</em></a>).
In many cases, there is a degeneracy where two photons from a single pump wave are converted into a pair of a signal and idler photon, with signal and idler frequencies to both sides of the pump frequency.
However, it is also possible to use a non-degenerate interaction with two separate pump waves.
In any case, the <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="gain bandwidth: the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a> is determined by dispersive properties of the fiber medium, but there can also be a significant influence of the <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="Kerr effect: a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr nonlinearity</a> of the fiber.</p>
