<h1>Fiber Amplifiers &ndash; a Technology for Many Applications, Part 1: Introduction</h1>

<p>(This article appeared in similar form in <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122603420/PDFSTART" rel="nofollow">Laser Technik Journal 6 (5), 48 (2009)</a>. See also <a href="article_fiber_amplifiers2.html">Part 2 &ndash; Various Technical Issues</a> and <a href="article_fiber_amplifiers3.html">Part 3 &ndash; Examples for Fiber Amplifier Designs</a>.)</p>
<p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Fiber amplifiers are technology with vary variants, covering an ever expanding area of applications. Part 1 of this series gives an introduction to the technical foundations. In later parts, technical limitations and case studies will be discussed.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> were developed in order to solve a pressing problem of telecommunications: the <a href="optical_data_transmission.html" title="optical data transmission: the transmission of information using light beams, e.g. in fibers">transmission of data</a> over large distances, where amplification between different spans of the transmission lines is required.
The direct optical amplification enabled by fiber amplifiers replaced a much more complicated technology, based on electronic detection and amplification and sending out new light signals.
This advance became one of the crucial foundations for a massive expansion of the transmission capacity, thus also for the Internet.</p>
<p>In the meantime, entirely new application areas have been established, in particular in industrial material processing.
Whereas the basic principle of amplification remained unchanged, substantial further technical developments have enabled the adaptation to total different requirements, such as the generation of much higher optical powers.
What is nowadays sold as a <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber laser</a>, usually contains a fiber amplifier.</p>
<p>This series begins with explaining the technical foundations.
Later parts will discuss various technical limitations and present a number of case studies.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Principle of Fiber Amplifiers</h2>
<div>
<p>Fiber amplifiers are based on &ldquo;active&rdquo; <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>, having a <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> which is doped with laser-active ions such as Er<sup>3+</sup>, Nd<sup>3+</sup> or Yb<sup>3+</sup>.
Normally a fiber coupler is used to introduce some &ldquo;pump light&rdquo; in addition to the input signal light.
This pump light is absorbed by the laser-active ions, transferring them into <a href="metastable_states.html" title="metastable states: excited states (particularly electronic states in laser gain media) which have a relatively long lifetime due to slow radiative and non-radiative decay">excited electronic states</a> and thus allowing the amplification of light at other wavelengths via <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="stimulated emission: a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a>.
Fig.&nbsp;1 shows schematically the setup of a simple fiber amplifier.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiber_amplifier.png" alt="fiber amplifier">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Setup of an erbium-doped fiber amplifier for telecom applications.
Pump light at 980&nbsp;nm from two laser diodes excites the erbium ions and enables them to amplify light around 1550&nbsp;nm.
Two <a href="faraday_isolators.html" title="Faraday isolators: optical isolators based on the Faraday effect">Faraday isolators</a> eliminate effects of reflections.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the amplified signal becomes intense, it reduces the excitation density of the ions, so that the amplification is <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="gain saturation: the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">saturated</a>.
Fiber amplifiers are often operated in the strongly saturated regime, which also allows for the highest output power.
Depending on the type of amplifier, the output power can be up to &sim;80&#37; of the pump power.</p>
<p>Excited ions can also <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="spontaneous emission: a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneously decay</a> into their ground state and emit <a href="fluorescence.html" title="fluorescence: luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> light in random directions.
Most of the fluorescence leaves the fiber in transverse directions.
A small part, however, is guided along the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> (in both directions) and can also be amplified.
If the amplifier gain is high (e.g. &gt;35 dB), this <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="amplified spontaneous emission: a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a> (ASE) can extract a substantial power (far more than the transverse fluorescence) and thus limit the achievable gain.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Double-clad Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>The <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> is often <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-moded</a>, i.e., it supports only a single guided mode per polarization direction.
This leads to an excellent <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> of the amplified light, even in cases where strong thermal effects occur in the fiber.
However, efficient direct injection of pump light into the core then requires that this pump light also has an excellent beam quality.
This excludes the use of high-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> as pump sources.</p>
<figure style="width:600px;">
<img src="img/dcf.png" alt="cladding-pumped fiber amplifier">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Fiber amplifier with a double-clad fiber. The signal light is injected into the fiber core, the pump light into the larger pump cladding. The pump cladding has a D shape, allowing for more efficient pump absorption than a circular profile.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That problem has been solved by the development of <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a> (Fig.&nbsp;2).
Here, the pump light is not directly injected into the fiber core, but into a pump cladding surrounding the core.
The pump light can not leave the pump core toward the outer side, as it is guided by an outer cladding with lower <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>.
On the other hand, the pump light has a certain overlap with the doped core, where it can be absorbed.
As the pump cladding has many guided modes, it is possible to utilize high-power pump diodes with poor beam quality.
Coupling to the pump cladding is comparatively easy.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Different Dopants</h2>
<div>
<p>Telecom fiber amplifiers are usually doped with erbium (Er<sup>3+</sup>), which can be pumped e.g. at 980&nbsp;nm and can amplify light around 1550&nbsp;nm.
The latter wavelength is ideal for telecommunications, as telecom fibers have extremely low absorption and scattering losses in this spectral region.
Also, such wavelengths are relatively <a href="eye_safe_lasers.html" title="eye-safe lasers: lasers emitting in a wavelength region with relatively low hazards for the human eye">eye-safe</a>, since that light is absorbed in the eye's lens before reaching the sensitive retina.
By optimizing the chemical composition of the fiber core, one can tailor the gain spectrum such that a nearly constant gain over a wide spectral region is achieved.
However, <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium amplifiers</a> are not ideally suited for the highest powers and a high efficiency.</p>
<p>For the 1-&mu;m spectral region, fiber amplifiers based on neodymium (Nd<sup>3+</sup>) were originally developed.
The amplification process is in principle similar to that in the well-known <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="YAG lasers: lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG</a> <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a>, but the fiber geometry and the glass material introduce substantial differences.
The possible wavelength ranges for pump and signal light are much broader, making a temperature stabilization of the pump diodes obsolete and allowing e.g. the amplification of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>.
The <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguiding</a> allows for a long interaction length without beam expansion or spatial distortions, guaranteeing a high beam quality of the output.
Due to the small mode area, the <a href="gain_efficiency.html" title="gain efficiency: small-signal gain of an optical amplifier per unit pump power or per unit stored energy">gain efficiency</a> (measured in dB/mW) is high, despite the reduced <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="transition cross sections: material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">transition cross sections</a>.
This allows to obtain a large gain even for small pump powers.</p>
<p>Later, fiber amplifiers based on ytterbium (Yb<sup>3+</sup>) became even more popular for the 1-&mu;m spectral region, as they have a still higher efficiency and high-power potential, and also offer a large <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="gain bandwidth: the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">amplification bandwidth</a>.
On the other hand, the <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="four-level and three-level gain media: laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level</a> behavior of ytterbium introduces some special aspects and limitations, and a good quantitative understanding of such issues is required to realize the full performance potential.</p>
<p>Thulium-doped fibers can be used for longer wavelengths such as 1.9 to 2&nbsp;&mu;m.
Despite the much shorter pump wavelength around 0.8&nbsp;&mu;m, which implies a large quantum defect, <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a> with optimized doping density can be surprisingly efficient.
This is because of a special <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="energy transfer: the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfer</a> process, where an excited thulium ion shares its energy with a nearby ion.
In that way, one obtains two ions in the upper laser level for one pump photon.</p>
<p>There are other laser-active ions in fibers, and other amplifier transitions, but these are more exotic and not discussed further here.</p>
