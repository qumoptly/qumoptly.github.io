<ul>

</ul>
<p>Material processing with high-power lasers is the second largest segment of laser applications concerning global turnovers (after communications).</p>
<p>There is no commonly accepted definition of the property &ldquo;high power&rdquo;; in the context of laser material processing, it usually means multiple kilowatts or at least a few hundred watts, whereas for laser displays some tens of watts many already be considered high.
In some areas, this label is assigned simply for generating a significantly higher output power than other lasers based on the same technology; for example, some &ldquo;high-powered&rdquo; <a href="laser_pointers.html" title="laser pointers: devices used for pointing at items with laser beams">laser pointers</a> emit a few hundred milliwatts, whereas ordinary laser pointers are limited to a few milliwatts.</p>
<p>Additional aspects come into play for <a href="pulsed_lasers.html" title="pulsed lasers: lasers emitting light in the form of pulses">pulsed lasers</a>.
For example, the <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> may be as important as the average output power for a <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="Q-switched lasers: lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched laser</a>.
Depending on the <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="pulse repetition rate: the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a> and <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="pulse duration: the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a>, the peak power may be very high even for a laser with a moderate average output power.
Usually, a high average power and not only a high peak power is expected from a high-power laser.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Technical Challenges</h2>
<div>
<p>The generation of high <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> in lasers involves a number of technical challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>One requires one or several powerful pump sources.
While <a href="lamp_pumped_lasers.html" title="lamp-pumped lasers: lasers which are pumped with flash lamps or arc lamps, or in rare cases with tungsten halogen lamps">lamp pumping</a> was originally the only viable approach for most <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>, pumping with high-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> (<a href="diode_bars.html" title="diode bars: a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a> or <a href="diode_stacks.html" title="diode stacks: arrangements of multiple diode bars, delivering very high output power">diode stacks</a>) has become more and more widespread.
<a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="diode-pumped lasers: solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">Diode-pumped lasers</a> now offer the highest output powers in <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="continuous-wave operation: operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave operation</a>.
For very high pulse energies (e.g. tens of joules), lamp pumping is still more practical.</li>
<li>At least for long-term continuous-wave operation, a high <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="wall-plug efficiency: total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">wall-plug efficiency</a> is an important economic factor.
Unfortunately, various technical challenges (e.g. thermal effects, see below) tend to make it more difficult at very high power levels to achieve a good efficiency.</li>
<li>Even in a fairly efficient <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>, a substantial fraction of the pump power is converted into heat, which can have a number of detrimental side effects.
In the worst case, thermally induced stress leads to fracture of the <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a>.
High-power <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> also exhibit strong <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="thermal lensing: a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>, making it substantially more difficult to achieve a high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
In lasers with <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">polarized output</a>, <a href="depolarization_loss.html" title="depolarization loss: losses of optical power in a laser resonator, caused by depolarization e.g. in a laser crystal">depolarization loss</a> often compromises the efficiency.
Efficient heat removal and thermal management are therefore important issues, and additional measures (e.g. in the context of <a href="resonator_design.html" title="resonator design: the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">resonator design</a>) are often required for coping with various kinds of thermal effects.</li>
<li>Particularly in <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="Q-switched lasers: lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>, very high <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical intensity: optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a> can occur, which may lead to <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">laser-induced damage</a> of optics (such as <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="laser mirrors: high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">laser mirrors</a>) e.g. via <a href="laser_induced_breakdown.html" title="laser-induced breakdown: a kind of spark, initiated by intense laser light">laser-induced breakdown</a>.
Even if the optical intensities remain well below the damage threshold of all optical elements, tiny dust particles can provoke damage phenomena.
It can therefore be essential to keep the laser setup very clean, e.g. by operating it in a sealed case which may be opened only in a clean room.
In addition, it can be imperative to use precision optics with a high <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage threshold</a>.</li>
<li>Various types of <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear effects</a> can also become relevant, particularly in <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber lasers</a>.
Examples are stimulated <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="Raman scattering: a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman scattering</a>, <a href="brillouin_scattering.html" title="Brillouin scattering: a nonlinear scattering effect involving acoustic phonons">Brillouin scattering</a> and <a href="four_wave_mixing.html" title="four-wave mixing: an interaction of light waves based on a &chi;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinearity">four-wave mixing</a>.</li>
<li><a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">Laser resonators</a> with large <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode areas</a> tend to be sensitive to <a href="alignment_sensitivity.html" title="alignment sensitivity: the sensitivity of a laser, an optical resonator or some other device with respect to misalignment">misalignment</a> and vibrations of optical components.
It can therefore be more challenging to achieve robust maintenance-free operation and a good <a href="beam_pointing_fluctuations.html" title="beam pointing fluctuations: fluctuations of the propagation direction of a laser beam">beam pointing stability</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Types of High-power Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>There are several different types of high-power lasers:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-power <a href="diode_bars.html" title="diode bars: a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a> and <a href="diode_stacks.html" title="diode stacks: arrangements of multiple diode bars, delivering very high output power">diode stacks</a> have already been mentioned above as possible pump sources for <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>.
They allow the generation of kilowatts of output power, but with a poor <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
For some applications, where beam quality is not essential, the direct use of high-power laser diodes (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="direct_diode_lasers.html" title="direct diode lasers: diode lasers which are directly used e.g. for material processing"><em>direct diode lasers</em></a>) e.g. for laser welding, soldering and brazing, cladding and heat treatment, is an interesting option, offering a comparatively simple, compact, cost-effective and energy-efficient solution.</li>
<li>There are various types of <a href="lamp_pumped_lasers.html" title="lamp-pumped lasers: lasers which are pumped with flash lamps or arc lamps, or in rare cases with tungsten halogen lamps">lamp-pumped</a> or <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="diode-pumped lasers: solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>.
<a href="rod_lasers.html" title="rod lasers: solid-state lasers with a rod-shaped gain medium">Rod lasers</a> can be optimized for several kilowatts of output power, but <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a> beam quality is possible only up to a few hundred watts (with significant efforts).
<a href="slab_lasers.html" title="slab lasers: solid-state bulk lasers where the gain medium has the form of a slab">Slab lasers</a> can be developed for tens of kilowatts or more with relatively high beam quality.
<a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="thin-disk lasers: solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">Thin-disk lasers</a> easily generate hundreds of watts with diffraction-limited beam quality and have the potential to reach that even at power levels well above 10&nbsp;kW.
The power efficiency is usually fairly good.</li>
<li><a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">High-power fiber lasers and amplifiers</a> can generate up to a few kilowatts with close to <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited beams</a> and high power efficiency.
With relaxed beam quality requirements, even significantly higher powers are possible.
Strictly, such fiber devices are often not <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a>, but <a href="master_oscillator_power_amplifier.html" title="master oscillator power amplifier: a laser system consisting of a seed laser and a laser amplifier for boosting the output power">master oscillator power amplifier</a> (MOPA) configurations.</li>
<li>Some <a href="gas_lasers.html" title="gas lasers: lasers with a gas (or plasma) as gain medium">gas lasers</a>, e.g. <a href="co2_lasers.html" title="CO<sub>2</sub> lasers: infrared lasers based on a gas mixture in which light is amplified by carbon dioxide molecules">CO<sub>2</sub> lasers</a> and <a href="excimer_lasers.html" title="excimer lasers: lasers where optical amplification occurs in a plasma containing excited dimers (or other molecules) with an anti-binding electronic ground state">excimer lasers</a>, are also suitable for hundreds or thousands of watts of output power.
They typically operate in different other regions than solid-state lasers, e.g. in the mid-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="infrared light: invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> or <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="ultraviolet light: invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> region.</li>
<li>There are chemical lasers with multi-kilowatt or even megawatt output powers, explored e.g. in the context of anti-missile weapons.</li>
</ul>
<p>A perhaps not very practical, but theoretically very interesting high-power laser concept is that of the <a href="radiation_balanced_lasers.html" title="radiation-balanced lasers: lasers where the heat generation in the gain medium is compensated by optical refrigeration in the same medium">radiation-balanced laser</a>.
Here, the heat generation in the <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> is essentially eliminated by <a href="optical_refrigeration.html" title="optical refrigeration: a technique for cooling macroscopic samples via laser-induced fluorescence">optical refrigeration</a>.</p>
<p>An aspect of great importance for further laser development is that of <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="power scaling of lasers: a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers"><em>power scaling</em></a>, based on certain power-scalable laser architectures.
Even for not power-scalable laser types, it can be very helpful to understand the scaling properties of various parts or techniques.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Safety Issues</h2>
<div>
<p>The use of high-power lasers raises important issues on <a href="laser_safety.html" title="laser safety: safety of the use of laser devices">laser safety</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The output powers are far higher than what any eye can tolerate, so that even tiny parasitic reflections must be safely prevented from reaching an eye.
Even the use of strongly absorbing <a href="eye_protection.html" title="eye protection: the protection of eyes against laser hazards">laser goggles</a> may not be sufficient, as such glasses may not be able to stand such high optical intensities for more than a brief moment of time.</li>
<li>The skin and clothes of workers are also at risk in environments where optical powers and intensities are sufficient e.g. for laser cutting of metals.</li>
<li>High-power <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a> may incinerate materials such as plastics or wood.
That happens easily already for laser powers of the order of 1&nbsp;W.
Fire protection is therefore an important issue.
Also, the formation of poisonous fumes needs to be avoided, or such fumes have to be efficiently removed.</li>
<li>There are various types of risks which are not related to the laser beams themselves.
In particular, high-power electric power supplies often involve high electric voltages, which can cause electric shocks.
Power cables, which can be damaged in a harsh industrial environment, can also create hazards.</li>
</ul>
<p>An important safety principle in the area of high-power lasers is to enclose the laser setup with a solid housing, and ideally also the whole area where dangerous laser beams can be present.
Interlocks can prevent the operation of a laser at times where persons are in a hazardous area.</p>

<h2>Evaluation of Technologies</h2>
<p>In the laser and photonics industry, it is often essential to obtain competent evaluations of certain technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A CTO of a laser company needs to know whether some new technical idea is worthwhile pursuing. Maybe there are some hidden problems?</li>
<li>A user of lasers is told about a great new laser architecture &ndash; but will it really serve her needs?</li>
<li>Venture capital firms need to find out what the potentials and limitations of certain technologies are. We call that applying <em>due diligence</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="spotlight_2009_10_1930d7.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
