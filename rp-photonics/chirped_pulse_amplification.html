This can be effectively prevented by employing the method of <em>chirped-pulse amplification</em> (CPA), which was originally developed in the context of radar technology, but later applied to optical amplifiers [3]:</p>
<p>Before passing through the amplifier medium, the pulses are <a href="chirp.html" title="chirp: time dependence of the instantaneous frequency of an optical pulse">chirped</a> and temporally stretched to a much longer duration by means of a strongly <a href="dispersion.html" title="dispersion: the dependence of the phase velocity in a medium on the optical frequency or the propagation mode">dispersive element</a> (the <em>stretcher</em>, e.g. a grating pair or a long <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>).
This reduces the <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> to a level where the above-mentioned detrimental effects in the gain medium are avoided.
After the gain medium, a dispersive <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="pulse compression: linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">compressor</a> is used, i.e., an element with opposite dispersion (typically a grating pair), which removes the chirp and temporally compresses the pulses to a duration similar to the input <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="pulse duration: the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a>.
As the peak power becomes very high at the compressor, the beam diameter on the compressor grating has to be large.
For the most powerful devices, a beam diameter of the order of 1&nbsp;m is required.</p>

<p>The method of chirped-pulse amplification has allowed the construction of table-top <a href="amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers: devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifiers</a> which can generate pulses with millijoule energies and femtosecond durations, leading to <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak powers</a> of several terawatts.
(1&nbsp;TW = 10<sup>12</sup>&thinsp;W, corresponding to the electric output of 1000 large nuclear power stations).
For the highest peak powers in <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>, amplifier systems consisting of several <a href="regenerative_amplifiers.html" title="regenerative amplifiers: optical amplifiers with a resonator in which a light pulse can do multiple round trips before being coupled out">regenerative</a> and/or <a href="multipass_amplifiers.html" title="multipass amplifiers: an amplifier with multiple passes through the gain medium">multipass amplifiers</a> are used, which are mostly based on <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers: lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">titanium&ndash;sapphire</a> crystals.
Such amplifiers can be used e.g. for <a href="high_harmonic_generation.html" title="high harmonic generation: the phenomenon that very high harmonics of an intense input laser beam are generated in a gas">high harmonic generation</a> in gas jets.
Large-scale facilities even reach peak powers in the petawatt range
(1&nbsp;PW = 1000&nbsp;TW = 10<sup>15</sup>&thinsp;W).

<h2 class="togglediv">Nobel Prize in Physics 2018</h2>

<p>In October 2018, the Nobel Prize in physics has been awarded with one half to Arthur Ashkin for work on <a href="optical_tweezers.html" title="optical tweezers: arrangements for capturing and moving particles with laser beams">optical tweezers</a> and the other half jointly to Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland.
The latter two have pioneered the method of chirp-pulse amplification.
That was recognized as an essential contribution for the development of laser devices with which one can produce enormously high optical intensities.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Stretcher and Compressor</h2>
<div>
<p>Several aspects of dispersive stretchers and compressors can be of crucial importance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Particularly in fiber-based systems (see below), it is important to obtain long stretched pulses, with durations e.g. of the order of 1&nbsp;ns, in order to minimize nonlinear effects in the <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a>.
This requires a large difference of <a href="group_delay.html" title="group delay: a measure of the time delay experienced by narrow-band light pulses in an optical device">group delay</a> within the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="optical spectrum: the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> of the input pulses.
Strong stretching and compression is possible e.g. with pairs of <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="diffraction gratings: optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction gratings</a>, or with <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a> and <a href="volume_bragg_gratings.html" title="volume Bragg gratings: Bragg gratings written into some bulk material">volume Bragg gratings</a>.
A simple Treacy compressor [1] can provide anomalous dispersion, whereas a Mart&iacute;nez-type setup containing two <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a> between the gratings [2] can provide normal dispersion.</li>
<li>At least for high-energy systems, the compressor needs to tolerate high optical <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak powers</a> without introducing nonlinear distortions.
Grating compressors are good in this respect, since they can be operated with large mode areas, while the use of fiber Bragg gratings limits the pulse energy to well below 1&nbsp;&mu;J.
<a href="volume_bragg_gratings.html" title="volume Bragg gratings: Bragg gratings written into some bulk material">Volume Bragg gratings</a> allow for higher energies, but are difficult to fabricate with large thickness and length.</li>
<li>The optical losses, which are relevant particularly in the compressor, can be substantial.
For example, when ordinary diffraction gratings are used for the compressor, the four reflections on gratings can easily cause a loss of &asymp;&thinsp;50&#37;.
In order not to lose half of the output power, special transmission gratings, fabricated with electron beam lithography, have been developed with losses of only &asymp;&thinsp;3&#37; or even less per reflection (at least for one polarization direction).
Another approach for reducing the compressor losses is <em>downchirped-pulse amplification</em>, where (e.g. for the 1-&mu;m spectral region) the stretcher has anomalous dispersion, so that the compressor can be a simple glass block with normal dispersion.</li>
<li>The quality of recompression depends on a good match between the dispersive properties of stretcher and compressor, and may also be spoiled by residual nonlinear effects and possibly by chromatic dispersion in the amplifier.
Grating compressors introduce substantial amounts of higher-order dispersion, which is difficult to match with dispersive fibers, but tailored nonlinearly chirped fiber Bragg gratings can be a solution.</li>
<li>The total amount of chromatic dispersion required in the stretcher and the compressor also depends on the initial pulse <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>, which should thus not be too small.
On the other hand, very large bandwidths introduce problems with matching higher-order dispersion, and <a href="gain_narrowing.html" title="gain narrowing: the phenomenon that the bandwidth of light can be reduced during amplification in a medium with a limited gain bandwidth">gain narrowing</a> in the amplifier is another issue.
Therefore, CPA systems work best for <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="pulse duration: the duration of an optical pulse">pulse durations</a> between roughly 20&nbsp;fs and a few hundred femtoseconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the performance required and on other requirements, different types of stretchers and compressors can present the best solution.
The highest performance is achieved if at least the compressor is made with bulk <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="diffraction gratings: optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction gratings</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Versus Bulk Amplifiers</h2>
<div>
<p>The concept of chirped-pulse amplification is also applied to <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a>.
Due to the inherently high nonlinearity of long <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>, CPA has to be applied already for relatively low pulse energies, and even with strong temporal stretching of the pulses, the achievable pulse energies remain limited to roughly 10&nbsp;mJ.
(Stretching the pulses to more than a few nanoseconds is not practical, and that pulse duration combined with a few megawatts of peak power, which is limited by catastrophic <a href="self_focusing.html" title="self-focusing: focusing of a beam in a transparent medium, caused by the beam itself through a nonlinear process in the medium">self-focusing</a>, leads to the order of 10&nbsp;mJ of energy.)
However, high average powers of tens of watts or even &gt;&thinsp;100&nbsp;W can be generated [11,&thinsp;14].
Fiber-based CPA systems are therefore most suitable for high pulse repetition rates combined with high average powers.
The fibers used for such systems should be optimized in various respects; they should have features such as a high gain per unit length, <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="polarization-maintaining fibers: specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining</a> properties (strong <a href="birefringence.html" title="birefringence: the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a>) and <a href="core_less_end_caps.html" title="core-less end caps: end pieces attached to fibers, containing no fiber core">core-less end caps</a>.</p>
<p>All-fiber solutions are possible, but very limited in terms of pulse energy.
Therefore, at least the compressor is often made with bulk-optical components.
In the future, it may become possible to replace bulky diffraction gratings with volume Bragg gratings while still achieving high pulse energies.</p>
<p>See also the article on <a href="fiber_lasers_versus_bulk_lasers.html">fiber lasers versus bulk lasers</a>, touching upon various aspects which also apply to CPA systems.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Optical Parametric Chirped-pulse Amplification</h2>
<div>
<p>The CPA concept is also applied to <a href="optical_parametric_amplifiers.html" title="optical parametric amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on parametric nonlinear interactions">optical parametric amplifiers</a>, and is then called <a href="optical_parametric_chirped_pulse_amplification.html" title="optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification: parametric amplification of chirped ultrashort pulses"><em>optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification</em></a> (<abbr title="optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification">OPCPA</abbr> [7]).
The article on <a href="optical_parametric_chirped_pulse_amplification.html" title="optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification: parametric amplification of chirped ultrashort pulses">optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification</a> contains more details.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">A Simple Variant</h2>
<div>
<p>A simple variant of CPA can be realized with a <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a> where the chirp of the pulses is automatically generated in the fiber, rather than with a pulse stretcher before the amplifier.
This can occur in fibers with normal <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>, where <a href="parabolic_pulses.html" title="parabolic pulses: pulses with a parabolic intensity profile">parabolic pulses</a> are formed.
Apart from not requiring a stretcher, an advantage of this method is that the chirp obtained is very close to linear.
See the article on <a href="parabolic_pulses.html" title="parabolic pulses: pulses with a parabolic intensity profile">parabolic pulses</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">&hellip; and an Exotic Application</h2>
<div>
<p>The CPA concept can also be utilized for <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="semiconductor optical amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifiers</a> (SOAs) [13].
In that case, the duration of the stretched pulses can be well beyond the carrier lifetime of the amplifier.
As a consequence, the achievable energy is no longer limited by the low <a href="saturation_power.html" title="saturation power: a measure of the incident optical power required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation power</a> of such amplifiers: the energy stored in the amplifier can replenished during amplification of the stretched pulse.
This means that the main purpose of CPA is in that case not avoiding effects of Kerr nonlinearity and <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage</a>, but increasing the extractable energy.
However, this energy is still low compared with that from amplifiers based on ion-doped gain media.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Final Remarks</h2>
<div>
<p>As mentioned above, CPA may not be practical for pulses with relatively long durations (several picoseconds or longer), since very large amounts of chromatic dispersion would be required in the stretcher and compressor.
In this regime, the technique of <a href="divided_pulse_amplification.html" title="divided-pulse amplification: a method of amplifying intense ultrashort pulse while avoiding excessive nonlinear effects">divided-pulse amplification</a> may be an interesting alternative.</p>
