<p>An avalanche photodiode is a semiconductor-based <a href="photodetectors.html" title="photodetectors: devices used for the detection of light">photodetector</a> (<a href="photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes: semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiode</a>) which is operated with a relatively high reverse voltage (typically tens or even hundreds of volts), sometimes just below breakdown.
In this regime, carriers (electrons and holes) excited by absorbed <a href="photons.html" title="photons: quanta of light energy">photons</a> are strongly accelerated in the strong internal electric field, so that they can generate secondary carriers, as it also occurs in <a href="photomultipliers.html" title="photomultipliers: photodetection devices based on the photoelectric effect and charge multiplication by secondary emission of electrons">photomultipliers</a>.
The avalanche process, which may take place over a distance of only a few micrometers, for example, effectively amplifies the photocurrent by a significant factor.
Therefore, avalanche photodiodes can be used for very sensitive detectors, which need less electronic signal amplification and are thus less susceptible to electronic noise.
However, the avalanche process itself is subject to <a href="quantum_noise.html" title="quantum noise: noise arising from quantum fluctuations">quantum noise</a> and amplification noise, which can offset the mentioned advantage.
The excess noise is quantified with the excess noise factor <span class="eqn_il"><i>F</i></span>, which is the factor by which the electronic noise power is increased compared with that of an ideal photodetector.</p>
<p>Note that the amplification factor and thus the effective <a href="responsivity.html" title="responsivity: photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> of an APD depends strongly on the reverse voltage, and may also substantially vary from device to device.
Therefore, it is common to specify a certain voltage range within which all devices reach a certain responsivity.
For precise measurements of low light powers, avalanche diodes are hardly suitable, since their responsitivity is not nearly as well defined is that of a p&ndash;i&ndash;n diode, for example.</p>
<p>The detection <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> achievable with avalanche diodes can be quite high, although there is an inherent trade-off between bandwidth and amplification factor.
On the other hand, the enhanced sensitivity can allow the operation with a smaller shunt resistor than usable with an ordinary photodiode, and that effect may compensate a possible speed disadvantage of an avalanche diode.</p>
<p>Generally, the noise performance of photodetectors with APDs can be better than that of devices with ordinary <a href="p_i_n_photodiodes.html" title="p&ndash;i&ndash;n photodiodes: photodiodes with a p&ndash;i&ndash;n semiconductor structure">p&ndash;i&ndash;n photodiodes</a> when electronic noise is a limiting factor: the internal amplification in an APD reduces the influences of electronic noise.
However, the above mentioned excess noise factor increases with increasing amplification factor, as obtained for increasing reverse voltage.
Therefore, the reverse voltage is often chosen such that the multiplication noise approximately equals the noise of the electronic amplifier, because this minimizes the overall noise.
The amount of excess noise depends on many factors: the magnitude of the reverse voltage, material properties (in particular, the ionization coefficient ratio <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&kappa;</span></span>), and the device design.</p>
<p>Silicon-based avalanche photodiodes are sensitive in the wavelength region from &asymp;&thinsp;450 to 1000&nbsp;nm (sometimes up to 1100&nbsp;nm), with the maximum <a href="responsivity.html" title="responsivity: photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a> occurring around 600&ndash;800&nbsp;nm, i.e., at somewhat shorter wavelengths than for silicon p&ndash;i&ndash;n diodes.
Depending on the device and the reverse voltage applied, the multiplication factor (also called <em>gain</em>) of silicon APDs can vary between 50 and 1000.
For longer wavelengths up to roughly 1.7&nbsp;&mu;m, APDs based on germanium or indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) are used.
These have lower current multiplication factors of 10 to 40.
InGaAs APDs are significantly more expensive than those based on germanium, but exhibit superior noise performance and a higher detection bandwidth.
Their high absorption coefficient allows the use of a rather thin absorbing layer.</p>
<p>Less common semiconductor materials for APDs are gallium nitride (GaN) for <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="ultraviolet light: invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a> and HgCdTe for the mid infrared up to wavelength of &asymp;14&nbsp;&mu;m (used under cryogenic conditions).</p>
<p>Typical applications of avalanche photodiodes include receivers in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, <a href="distance_measurements_with_lasers.html" title="distance measurements with lasers: measurements of distances using laser light">range finding</a>, imaging, high-speed laser scanners, <a href="laser_microscopy.html" title="laser microscopy: a technique for generating microscopic images by scanning objects with a laser">laser microscopy</a>, and optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR).</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Geiger Mode for Single Photon Counting</h2>
<div>
<p>When operated in the so-called <em>Geiger mode</em> with carefully designed electronics, avalanche photodiodes can be used even for <a href="single_photon_counting.html" title="single photon counting: photodetection at low light levels where single photon absorption events are counted">single photon counting</a> with dark count rates well below 1&nbsp;kHz and with a <a href="quantum_efficiency.html" title="quantum efficiency: percentage of input photons which contribute to a desired effect">quantum efficiency</a> of several tens of percent, sometimes even well above 50&#37;.
The Geiger mode means that the diode is operated slightly above the breakdown threshold voltage, where a single electron&ndash;hole pair (generated by absorption of a photon or by a thermal fluctuation) can trigger a strong avalanche.
In the case of such an event, an electronic quenching circuit reduces the voltage at the diode below the threshold voltage for a short time, so that the avalanche is stopped and the detector is ready for detection of further photons after some recovery time of e.g. 100&nbsp;ns.
That dead time constitutes a substantial limitation of this technology.
It limits the count rate to the order of 10&nbsp;MHz, whereas an avalanche diode in linear mode (i.e., operated with lower reverse voltage) may be operated with a bandwidth of many gigahertz.</p>
<p>Photon-counting APDs are also called SPADs = <em>single-photon avalanche diodes</em>.
They can be used in <a href="quantum_optics.html" title="quantum optics: the part of optics which deals with quantum effects">quantum optics</a> experiments (for example, for <a href="quantum_cryptography.html" title="quantum cryptography: methods to encrypt information securely, relying on quantum-mechanical phenomena">quantum cryptography</a>) and in some of the applications mentioned above if an extremely high sensitivity is required.
SPADs with optimized amplifier electronics are also available in CMOS integrated form, even as large detector arrays for single-photon 3D imaging via time-resolved detection [9].</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it is even possible to measure the number of photons absorbed within a certain short time interval in the active region of an avalanche photodiode [8].
For that purpose, it is necessary to precisely measure the rise of photocurrent at the beginning of the avalanche.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Avalanche Diode Modules</h2>
<div>
<p>Avalanche diodes are available as part of modules which apart from the photodiode also contain additional electronic components.
In particular, there can be a current amplifier (transimpedance amplifier) integrated into the package, which not only reduces the number of parts required on a circuit board, but also improves the noise performance and results in a better combination of <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> and <a href="responsivity.html" title="responsivity: photocurrent per unit optical power incident on a photodetector">responsivity</a>.
Some modules have been specifically optimized for use in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> systems and are fiber-coupled.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Silicon Photomultipliers</h2>
<div>
<p>An important difference between an avalanche photodiode and a <a href="photomultipliers.html" title="photomultipliers: photodetection devices based on the photoelectric effect and charge multiplication by secondary emission of electrons">photomultiplier</a> is that the latter has a much larger active area.
However, it is possible to construct so-called <em>silicon photomultipliers</em>, containing arrays of silicon-based avalanche diodes, where the combined active area can be fairly large.</p>
<p>Apart from the large active area, silicon photomultipliers are also suitable for measuring photon numbers [12], even if the single diodes are not: one may count the total number of diodes which are triggered by a weak incident optical pulse.
That number approximates well the photon number (multiplied with the <a href="quantum_efficiency.html" title="quantum efficiency: percentage of input photons which contribute to a desired effect">quantum efficiency</a>) provided that the probability of more than one photon hitting a single diode is sufficiently small.</p>
