<p>Various laser architectures allow the development of <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="high-power lasers: lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power laser</a> sources with high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, i.e., high <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a>.
However, all of these approaches have their limitations, and some envisaged <a href="laser_applications.html" title="laser applications: applications involving laser devices">laser applications</a> would require a higher laser power and brightness than appears to be feasible with any known laser technology.
Another problem is that very high-power laser systems are developed and built only in small numbers, making the devices fairly expensive.</p>
<p>A viable solution to these challenges could be the principle of <em>beam combining</em>, which essentially means combining the outputs of multiple laser sources (often in the form of laser arrays) so as to obtain a single output beam.
The use of a scalable beam-combining technology leads to a <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="power scaling of lasers: a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power-scalable</a> laser source, even if the single lasers are not scalable.</p>
<p>The goal of beam combining is generally not only to multiply the output power, but also to preserve the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, so that the <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> is increased (nearly) as much as the output power.
Therefore, it is generally not sufficient, e.g., to combine mutually incoherent beams side by side, because this would increase the beam area while not decreasing the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>, consequently increasing the <a href="beam_parameter_product.html" title="beam parameter product: product of the beam radius in a focus and the far-field beam divergence">beam parameter product</a> and reducing the beam quality.</p>
<p>There are many different approaches for beam combining with increased brightness, but these can all be grouped into one of two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="coherent_beam_combining.html" title="coherent beam combining: a class of methods for beam combining, requiring mutual coherence of the combined beams"><em>Coherent beam combining</em></a> works with beams which are mutually coherent.
Coherent <a href="polarization_beam_combining.html" title="polarization beam combining: a technique for combining two polarized laser beams"><em>polarization beam combining</em></a> is one variant; other techniques are side-by-side combining and filled-aperture combining.
In the conceptually simplest case, monochromatic beams with the same optical frequency are combined.
However, some schemes of coherent beam combination work with emission on multiple frequencies, with the emission spectra of all emitters being the same.
That technique can also be applied to broadband <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>.</li>
<li><a href="spectral_beam_combining.html" title="spectral beam combining: a class of methods for beam combining, based on wavelength-sensitive beam combiners"><em>Spectral beam combining</em></a> (also called <em>wavelength beam combining</em> or <em>incoherent beam combining</em>) does not require mutual coherence, but rather uses emitters with non-overlapping optical spectra.
The single beams are then fed into a wavelength-sensitive beam combiner, such as a <a href="prisms.html" title="prisms: transparent optical devices which refract or reflect light">prism</a>, a <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="diffraction gratings: optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction grating</a>, a <a href="dichroic_mirrors.html" title="dichroic mirrors: mirrors with significantly different reflection or transmission properties at two different wavelengths">dichroic mirror</a>, or a <a href="volume_bragg_gratings.html" title="volume Bragg gratings: Bragg gratings written into some bulk material">volume Bragg grating</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These techniques are discussed in more detail in the corresponding articles.
They can be applied to various laser sources, e.g., based on <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> (particularly <a href="diode_bars.html" title="diode bars: a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a>) and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a>, but also to high-power <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a> and <a href="vertical_external_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="vertical external-cavity surface-emitting lasers: surface-emitting semiconductor lasers with an external laser resonator">VECSELs</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Comparison of Coherent and Spectral Beam Combining</h2>
<div>
<p>Coherent and spectral beam combining techniques are substantially different in various respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spectral beam combining has the great advantage of not requiring mutual temporal coherence of the combined beams.
This eliminates some important technical challenges and makes it much easier to obtain stable operation at high power levels.
It may also be beneficial that a stable polarization is not required in principle, although e.g. the use of <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="diffraction gratings: optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction gratings</a> often reintroduces this requirement.</li>
<li>If <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> are used, the requirement of <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="single-frequency operation: an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency operation</a>, which is associated with some techniques of coherent combining, makes it more difficult to reach high power levels, because it favors <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear effects</a> such as stimulated <a href="brillouin_scattering.html" title="Brillouin scattering: a nonlinear scattering effect involving acoustic phonons">Brillouin scattering</a>.</li>
<li>Spectral beam combining inevitably generates output beams with several (or many) spectral components, thus spanning a significant optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.
This means that the <a href="spectral_brightness.html" title="spectral brightness: brightness per unit optical bandwidth">spectral brightness</a> is even reduced compared with that of the single emitters.
This does not matter for some applications while excluding others, where a narrow-<a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> output is required.</li>
<li>At least compared with tiled-aperture techniques of coherent beam combining, spectral beam combining makes it easier to combine the beams without any significant loss of beam quality.</li>
<li>Spectral beam combining is also superior in terms of more <em>graceful degradation</em>, because the failure of one emitter simply reduces the output power accordingly, whereas in the case of tiled-aperture coherent beam combining it also affects the output beam quality and thus reduces the output brightness even more than the power.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, it is to be expected that methods of spectral beam combining will find more widespread application, although coherent methods will in some cases be required, e.g. due to constraints concerning the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="optical spectrum: the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>It is expected that beam-combined laser systems will in the near future reach output power levels of tens to hundreds of kilowatts.
Possible <a href="laser_applications.html" title="laser applications: applications involving laser devices">applications</a> of such systems are often in the military sector, e.g., in the context of anti-missile and other directed energy laser weapons.
There are also possibilities for long-distance <a href="free_space_optical_communications.html" title="free-space optical communications: optical data transmission through free space, usually through air or vacuum">free-space optical communications</a> [1] and laser-based manufacturing.</p>
