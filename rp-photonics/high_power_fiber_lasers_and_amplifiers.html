<p>Whereas the first <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> could deliver only a few milliwatts of output power, there have subsequently been rapid developments which have lead to <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="high-power lasers: lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power</a> fiber lasers and particularly <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">amplifiers</a> with output powers of tens or hundreds of watts, sometimes even several kilowatts from a single <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>.
This potential arises from a very high surface-to-volume ratio (avoiding excessive heating) and the guiding (<a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a>) effect, which avoids thermo-optical problems even under conditions of significant heating.</p>
<p>Fiber laser technology now competes strongly with other <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="high-power lasers: lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power laser</a> technologies based on <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>, such as <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="thin-disk lasers: solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk lasers</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Double-clad Fibers and Beam Quality</h2>
<div>
<p>High-power fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers are nearly always realized with <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped</a> <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a>, which are pumped with <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled</a> high-power <a href="diode_bars.html" title="diode bars: a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a> or other kinds of <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a>.
The pump light is launched into an inner cladding rather than into the (much smaller) <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>, in which the laser light is generated.
The laser light can have very good <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> &ndash; even <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a> beam quality if the fiber has a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a> <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a>.
Therefore, the <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> of the fiber laser output can be orders of magnitude higher than that of the pump light, even though the output power is of course somewhat smaller.
Double-clad fiber lasers can thus effectively be used as <a href="brightness_converters.html" title="brightness converters: optically pumped devices where the generated optical output has a higher brightness than the optical pump source">brightness converters</a>.
Typical optical-to-optical power efficiencies are above 50&#37;, sometimes even above 80&#37;; the overall electrical-to-optical power conversion efficiency of a diode-pumped fiber laser can be of the order of 50&#37; for an Yb-based fiber laser pumped with efficient high-power diode lasers.</p>

<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span>

</figure>
<p>For the highest powers, the core area needs to be fairly large (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes"><em>large mode area fibers</em></a>), because the <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical intensity: optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a> would otherwise become too high, and often also because a double-clad fiber with a large ratio of cladding to core area has a weak <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="pump absorption: the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a>.
For core areas up to the order of a few thousand &mu;m<sup>2</sup>, it is feasible to have a single-mode core.
Larger mode areas with still fairly good output beam quality are possible with a slightly <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode</a> core, where most of the light propagates in the fundamental mode.
(The excitation of <a href="higher_order_modes.html" title="higher-order modes: transverse modes of a resonator or waveguide, excluding the fundamental (axial) modes">higher-order fiber modes</a> can be suppressed to some extent e.g. by coiling the fiber, except if one obtains strong <a href="mode_coupling.html" title="mode coupling: a concept for describing and calculating light propagation in certain situations, e.g. involving nonlinear interactions">mode coupling</a> at high power levels [14].)
For even larger mode areas, the beam quality can no longer be nearly diffraction-limited, but it can still be fairly good compared with, e.g., <a href="rod_lasers.html" title="rod lasers: solid-state lasers with a rod-shaped gain medium">rod lasers</a> operating at similar power levels.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Launching the Pump Light</h2>
<div>
<p>There are several options for launching pump light at very high power levels.
The simplest is to launch directly into the pump cladding at one or both fiber ends (see Figure&nbsp;2).
This technique does not require special fiber components; however, it needs the propagation of the high-power pump radiation through air (with free-space optics) and particularly through an air&ndash;glass interface, which is then very sensitive to dust and misalignment.
In many cases, it is therefore preferable to use one of several techniques where one employs <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled pump diodes</a> and keeps the pump light in fibers from there on (see Figure&nbsp;3).
One option is to launch the pump light into passive (undoped) fibers which are wound around the active fiber so that the light is gradually transferred into the active fiber (<em>GTWave fiber</em>).
Other techniques are based on special pump combiner devices, where several pump fibers and a single active signal fiber are fused together.
Yet other approaches are based on side-pumped fiber coils (<em>fiber disk lasers</em>) [3], or on grooves in the pump cladding through which pump light can be injected.
The latter technique allows for <em>multi-point pump injection</em> and thus for a better distribution of the heat load.</p>

</figure>
<p>A comparison of all the different pump launching techniques is complex, since it involves many aspects: not only the transfer efficiency, but also the loss of <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a>, the ease of manufacturing, the flexibility of handling, possible back-reflections, leakage of light from the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> back to the pump source, the option to <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="polarization-maintaining fibers: specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">maintain the polarization</a>, etc.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Lasers and Amplifiers</h2>
<div>
<p>The conceptually simplest option for generating high-power <a href="laser_light.html" title="laser light: light generated with a laser device">laser light</a> is to build a fiber laser directly with some kind of mirrors on both ends.
However, high-power fiber devices are very often built as laser-amplifier combinations, i.e., with a <a href="master_oscillator_fiber_amplifier.html" title="master oscillator fiber amplifier: a laser system containing a fiber amplifier for boosting the output power">MOFA</a> (<em>master oscillator fiber amplifier</em>) architecture.
This concept has several advantages.
It is easier to control the emission properties of a lower-power <a href="seed_lasers.html" title="seed lasers: lasers which are used for generating some seed light into an amplifier or another laser">seed laser</a> in terms of <a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a>, <a href="laser_noise.html" title="laser noise: fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">laser noise</a>, <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tunability</a>, <a href="pulse_generation.html" title="pulse generation: the generation of light pulses (flashes)">pulse generation</a>, etc.
Also, the fiber of an amplifier has to stand only a power about equal to the output power, whereas in a laser the intracavity power is higher (even though fiber lasers as high-gain devices allow for strong output coupling).
Furthermore, it can be advantageous to use a modular design approach, where amplifier stages can be combined as required.
In many cases, particularly when a low-power <a href="seed_lasers.html" title="seed lasers: lasers which are used for generating some seed light into an amplifier or another laser">seed laser</a> is used, one even uses several <a href="amplifier_chains.html" title="amplifier chains: amplifiers consisting of several stages">amplifier stages</a>, typically with increasing mode areas and pump powers along the chain.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Nanosecond Pulses</h2>
<div>
<p>Many high-power lasers for material processing are <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="Q-switched lasers: lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>, generating intense nanosecond pulses.
In this regime, fiber devices are limited mainly in terms of <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a>: apart from various nonlinearities, <a href="self_focusing.html" title="self-focusing: focusing of a beam in a transparent medium, caused by the beam itself through a nonlinear process in the medium">self-focusing</a> introduces a hard limit at a few megawatts of peak power, which notably cannot be increased by using larger mode areas.
Actually achieved peak powers are usually below 1&nbsp;MW, even for large mode area fibers.
This means that, e.g., <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="pulse energy: energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a> are limited to a few millijoules if the <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="pulse duration: the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> is one nanosecond.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the high <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> of fiber devices allows the realization of very flexible <a href="master_oscillator_power_amplifier.html" title="master oscillator power amplifier: a laser system consisting of a seed laser and a laser amplifier for boosting the output power">MOPA devices</a> with a <a href="gain_switching.html" title="gain switching: a technique for generating short optical pulses in a laser by modulating the laser gain">gain-switched</a> <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diode</a> as <a href="seed_lasers.html" title="seed lasers: lasers which are used for generating some seed light into an amplifier or another laser">seed laser</a>.
This approach, unlike <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a> of a laser, allows one, e.g., to modify the pulse duration independently of the pulse repetition rate.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Ultrashort Pulses</h2>
<div>
<p>The large <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="gain bandwidth: the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a> of fiber amplifiers allows for the amplification of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>.
However, particularly in this regime significant challenges arise from the strong fiber <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearity</a>, because high-energy femtosecond pulses have huge <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak powers</a>.
In addition to the risk of fiber damage, strong nonlinear distortions can result from the fiber nonlinearity, and the high level of <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> (including higher-order dispersion) can also be problematic.
Particularly if pulse quality matters, these matters need to be carefully considered.</p>
<p>One possible approach is to make fiber-based <a href="chirped_pulse_amplification.html" title="chirped-pulse amplification: a technique for amplifying pulses to very high optical intensities while avoiding excessive nonlinear pulse distortions or optical damage">chirped-pulse amplification</a> systems, where the <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="pulse duration: the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a> within the amplifier is strongly increased, so that the effect of nonlinearities is accordingly decreased.
An alternative to this approach is the amplification of <a href="parabolic_pulses.html" title="parabolic pulses: pulses with a parabolic intensity profile">parabolic pulses</a>, where up-chirped pulses experiencing the <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> and <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearity</a> of the amplifier fiber evolve in a self-similar fashion, and their close to linear <a href="chirp.html" title="chirp: time dependence of the instantaneous frequency of an optical pulse">chirp</a> makes it possible to obtain a high pulse quality with dispersive <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="pulse compression: linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">compression</a>.</p>
<p>Although the mentioned techniques have allowed for extraordinary performance of fiber-based high-power ultrashort pulse sources (at least for multi-megahertz <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="pulse repetition rate: the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a> and correspondingly moderate <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="pulse energy: energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a>), these achievements are usually based on setups which involve a lot of free-space optics and hence lose many of the advantages of fiber systems.
An interesting direction is the development of all-fiber ultrashort pulse sources, possibly allowing for a final free-space pulse compressor (e.g. a transmission grating), but eliminating the need to launch pulses from free space into a fiber.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Prospects for Further Improvements</h2>
<div>
<p>Even though the progress in the development of high-power fiber devices has been tremendous in recent years, various kinds of more or less severe limitations are now encountered, which are expected to slow this progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>The optical intensities in high-power fiber devices have been enormously increased.
Now they are often close to the <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damage threshold</a> of the material.
Therefore, increased mode areas (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes"><em>large mode area fibers</em></a>) are used, but the limits of this approach have also been more or less reached, at least if very high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> is required.</li>
<li>The power dissipation per unit length has reached values of the order of 100&nbsp;W/m, which causes significant heating for air-cooled fibers.
However, water cooling will allow for significant further increases in power.
A longer fiber with lower <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="doping concentration: the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a> makes the cooling easier, but increases the effect of nonlinearities.</li>
<li>For fibers which are not strictly <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a>, certain mode instabilities occur at output power levels above some threshold, which is typically a few hundred watts.
Such mode instabilities lead to a sudden loss of <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and are based on thermal gratings (rapid spatial temperature oscillations) in the fiber.</li>
<li>Fiber <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> can be disturbing in various ways.
Even in <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="continuous-wave operation: operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> devices, the <a href="raman_gain.html" title="Raman gain: optical gain arising from stimulated Raman scattering">Raman gain</a> can become so high (tens of decibels) that a significant part of the power is transferred to a longer-wavelength Stokes wave, which does not experience laser gain.
Single-frequency operation is even much more limited due to stimulated <a href="brillouin_scattering.html" title="Brillouin scattering: a nonlinear scattering effect involving acoustic phonons">Brillouin scattering</a>, although a number of measures are known to mitigate this effect to some extent.
In devices for <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> from <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>, <a href="self_phase_modulation.html" title="self-phase modulation: nonlinear phase modulation of a beam, caused by its own intensity via the Kerr effect">self-phase modulation</a> can cause strong spectral broadening.
In addition, there can be other problems such as <a href="nonlinear_polarization_rotation.html" title="nonlinear polarization rotation: the phenomenon that the change in the polarization direction of light in a fiber can depend on the optical intensity">nonlinear polarization rotation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to such limitations, high-power fiber devices can &ndash; contrary to common opinions &ndash; usually not be considered as power-scalable in a strict sense, at least not well beyond the already achieved performance level.
(Previous advances have also largely <em>not</em> been achieved with simple power scaling, but with improved fiber designs and pump diodes.)
This has important consequences e.g. when fiber laser technology is compared with that of <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="thin-disk lasers: solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk lasers</a>.
The article on <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="power scaling of lasers: a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scaling of lasers</a> discusses this in more detail.</p>
<p>Of course, even without true power scalability, a lot can be done to improve various kinds of high-power fiber devices.
An important issue is the further development of advanced fiber designs, e.g. with very <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode areas</a> and single-mode guidance, as often realized with <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="photonic crystal fibers: specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a>.
Various kinds of fiber devices are also important, e.g. special pump couplers, tapers for connecting fibers with different mode sizes and special cooling arrangements.
Once the limit of the power per fiber has been reached, <a href="beam_combining.html" title="beam combining: a class of techniques for power scaling of laser sources by combining the outputs of multiple devices">beam combining</a> will be a further option
&ndash; fiber devices appear suitable for this technique.
Also for <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulse</a> amplifier systems there are various interesting options to mitigate and partially even to exploit the fiber nonlinearity, e.g. for further spectral broadening and subsequent <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="pulse compression: linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">pulse compression</a>.</p>
