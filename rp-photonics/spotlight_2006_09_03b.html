Paschotta et al., &ldquo;Single-frequency ytterbium-doped fiber laser stabilized by spatial hole burning&rdquo;, <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-22-1-40" rel="nofollow">Opt. Lett. 22 (1), 40 (1997)</a>; encyclopedia articles on <a href="spatial_hole_burning.html" title="spatial hole burning: a distortion of the gain shape in a laser medium (or the loss spectrum in a saturable absorber medium), caused by saturation effects of a standing wave">spatial hole burning</a> and <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="single-frequency lasers: lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency lasers</a></p>
<p>It is widespread textbook knowledge that the phenomenon of <a href="spatial_hole_burning.html" title="spatial hole burning: a distortion of the gain shape in a laser medium (or the loss spectrum in a saturable absorber medium), caused by saturation effects of a standing wave">spatial hole burning</a> is the effect which in many cases makes <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="single-frequency operation: an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency operation</a> of a <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> impossible.
This is quite easy to understand: if the laser oscillates only on a single <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="resonator modes: modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator mode</a>, spatial hole burning inevitably leads to a stronger <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="gain saturation: the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">saturation of the gain</a> for that lasing mode than for other modes, which all have less overlap with the saturation pattern.</p>
<p>It is also not difficult to grasp that in an <em>absorbing medium</em> the effect can be essentially the opposite: an oscillating mode in an unpumped <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="four-level and three-level gain media: laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level gain medium</a> can saturate the absorption for itself more than for other modes.
This idea has been exploited in 1994 and 1995 (see the references above): a section of unpumped erbium-doped fiber in a <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber laser</a> can serve to narrow the <a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> or even stabilize single-frequency operation.
In both cases, spatial hole burning in the gain section has been reduced (e.g. by unidirectional operation of a <a href="ring_lasers.html" title="ring lasers: lasers with a ring resonator">ring resonator</a>), so that essentially only the stabilizing effect of SHB could become effective.</p>
<p>Still it should appear unlikely that spatial hole burning could be beneficial for single-frequency operation of a simple standing-wave fiber laser, even if the fiber is overlong, so that a part of it is unpumped.
After all, the laser <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> must be higher than the saturable losses for lasing to occur; therefore, one should expect that the stabilizing effect of the absorbing fiber section should be weaker than the destabilizing effect of the gain section.
Therefore, the author of these lines would not have been stupid enough to try building such a laser, had he not envisaged that some subtle properties of <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="gain saturation: the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">gain saturation</a> can under certain circumstances totally modify the balance of stabilizing and destabilizing effects.
Specifically, this is the case for an <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="ytterbium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped</a> fiber laser pumped at 975&nbsp;nm, where the <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="pump absorption: the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> is strongly saturated for pump powers e.g. around 100&nbsp;mW.
A closer inspection of the corresponding equations shows that the effective signal saturation power can be strongly increased in this regime.
In effect, the saturation effects caused by the laser wave are strongly reduced in the gain section of the fiber, but not in the unpumped absorbing section.
The experiment worked very nicely: the laser operated in a very stable fashion on a single resonator mode.
Even when the fiber was heated and the mode frequency drifted away over a distance corresponding to several hundred times the <a href="free_spectral_range.html" title="free spectral range: frequency spacing of the axial modes of an optical resonator">free spectral range</a> of the laser resonator, the laser insisted still to lase on the original mode, despite the now higher intrinsic gain of other modes.</p>
<p>Note that such an experiment could have been done only either by a totally ignorant person (not knowing about the effect of spatial hole burning) or by someone understanding all this really well, but not by a half-educated person &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; from text books that such an attempt could only fail.</p>

<h2>The Transparent Laser</h2>
<p>The dream of each laser developer, and not only of each laser scientist: have a <b>transparent laser</b>, where you can <b>look into any components</b> and see e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>optical intensities</li>
<li>excitation densities of laser-active ions</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and this at any location and time, with arbitrary resolution!</p>
<p>If you had this, finally you could</p>
<ul>
<li>fully understand what goes on in your laser,</li>
<li>quickly identify and fix any problems, and</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">make faster progress <br> while saving a lot of money.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely marvelous, but only a dream?!?</p>
<p>Good news: such transparent lasers can be made!
