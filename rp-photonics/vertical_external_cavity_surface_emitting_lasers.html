Compared with other types of semiconductor lasers, VECSELs can generate very high <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> in <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited beams</a>, i.e., with high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.

<p>The semiconductor device (gain chip) may contain only a single semiconductor <a href="bragg_mirrors.html" title="Bragg mirrors: mirror structures based on Bragg reflection at a period structure">Bragg mirror</a> and the active region (gain region) with typically several <a href="quantum_wells.html" title="quantum wells: thin layers confining carriers in one dimension">quantum wells</a> (QWs).
The semiconductor structure typically has a total thickness of only a few micrometers (not including the semiconductor substrate), and is mounted on some kind of heat sink.
The <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> is completed with an external <a href="laser_mirrors.html" title="laser mirrors: high-quality mirrors used in laser resonators and other optical setups">mirror</a>, typically in a distance between a few millimeters and some tens of centimeters.
(For good <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, the length of the resonator should not be much smaller than the <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="Rayleigh length: the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a> of the intracavity beam.)
The laser mode size in the semiconductor chip is essentially defined by the external resonator setup.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Electrical Versus Optical Pumping</h2>
<div>
<p>In principle, electrical pumping is the preferred approach, since otherwise an additional pump laser is required.
Electrically pumped VECSELs have a gain structure similar to that of a <a href="vertical_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers: a monolithic kind of semiconductor lasers with beam emission perpendicular to the wafer surface">VCSEL</a>, where a ring electrode around the active area injects carriers into that region.
Unfortunately, this technique limits the usable active area and thus the output power, since it is difficult to pump large areas uniformly in this way, avoiding a weakly pumped region at the center of the active area.
So far, the powers achievable with such devices appear to be limited to the order of 1&nbsp;W [8].</p>
<p><a href="optical_pumping.html" title="optical pumping: electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">Optical pumping</a> avoids this limitation; it is easy in this way to pump arbitrarily large active areas uniformly.
Furthermore, the design of the gain structure is very much simplified, since doped regions for carrying the current are not required, nor apertures to direct the current flow.
The pump light is typically taken from a high-brightness <a href="broad_area_laser_diodes.html" title="broad area laser diodes: laser diodes with a strongly asymmetric shape of the emitting region">broad-area laser diode</a> or from a <a href="diode_bars.html" title="diode bars: a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bar</a>.
Due to the very short absorption length of the semiconductor gain structure (at least for spacer pumping; see below), the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> of the pump light is not very important; a poor beam quality only requires working with a strongly converging pump beam, which requires more space and may make it more difficult to arrange the intracavity elements.
It is possible, however, to achieve tens of watts of output power [9,&thinsp;32] when pumping with a diode bar.</p>
<p>Note that an external resonator is necessary for achieving <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a> output, when the mode area is large.
Therefore, VCSELs are not suitable for high powers with perfect beam quality, even with optical pumping.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Cooling Techniques and Power Scalability</h2>
<div>
<p>Compared with <a href="vertical_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers: a monolithic kind of semiconductor lasers with beam emission perpendicular to the wafer surface">VCSELs</a>, VECSELs can have much larger beam areas (diameters of hundreds of microns), particularly for optical pumping.
This keeps the <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical intensity: optical power per unit area">optical intensity</a> at a reasonable level, even for high output powers.</p>
<p>Another issue is the extraction of the dissipated heat.
When using a gain structure grown on a wafer with, e.g., 0.5&nbsp;mm thickness, and not applying special cooling techniques, the devices become too hot unless the active area and output power are again fairly limited.
This limitation results from the substantial thermal impedance of the semiconductor structure.
There are, however, techniques to achieve much more efficient cooling, as described in the following.</p>
<p>One approach is to use a specially processed very thin semiconductor structure on an efficient heat sink.
This can be fabricated by first growing the semiconductor layers in reverse order (upside down) on a normal wafer, then soldering the surface to a metallic heat sink, and finally removing the substrate by etching (up to an etch stop, which has also been epitaxially grown).
One obtains a semiconductor structure with a thickness of the order of 5&ndash;10&nbsp;&mu;m and thus a strongly reduced thermal impedance.</p>
<p>Another approach is to attach a transparent heat spreader to the emitting surface.
Such heat spreaders can be made e.g. of diamond, silicon carbide or sapphire.
Due to their good transparency for the laser and pump wavelength, they may not substantially degrade the laser efficiency.</p>
<p>Both cooling techniques can lead one into a regime where <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="power scaling of lasers: a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scaling</a> is possible.
The power scaling procedure for doubling the output power is essentially to apply twice the pump power to twice the active area.
For large areas, the heat flow is dominantly in the longitudinal direction, and doubling the area also doubles the cooling capability.
This means that device temperatures do not rise significantly for further increased active areas.
However, thermally induced stress effects, which may also affect the beam quality, do become stronger for higher powers, so that power scaling is not entirely easy.</p>
<p>As the geometry of a VECSEL <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> is that of a thin disk, <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="optical pumping: electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">optically pumped</a> VECSELs are sometimes called <em>semiconductor disk lasers</em>.
In fact, they are similar to <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="thin-disk lasers: solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk lasers</a>, with which they share their concept of <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="power scaling of lasers: a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power scaling</a>, despite the different kind of gain medium.
It is not clear yet what the power limits for these types of lasers are.</p>
<p>Considering that such a VECSEL can generate an essentially <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited beam</a> while working with a pump source with potentially very poor <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> (e.g. a high-power <a href="diode_bars.html" title="diode bars: a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bar</a>), an optically pumped VECSEL can be considered as an efficient <a href="brightness_converters.html" title="brightness converters: optically pumped devices where the generated optical output has a higher brightness than the optical pump source">brightness converter</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Accessible Wavelengths and Details of VECSEL Gain Structures</h2>
<div>
<p>A typical VECSEL gain structure contains a <a href="bragg_mirrors.html" title="Bragg mirrors: mirror structures based on Bragg reflection at a period structure">Bragg mirror</a> and an active region with multiple <a href="quantum_wells.html" title="quantum wells: thin layers confining carriers in one dimension">quantum wells</a> (<em>MQW active region</em>), all of which are fabricated with an epitaxial process (normally either MOCVD or MBE) on a semiconductor wafer.
The wafer material defines the lattice constant and thus restricts the choice of materials to be used.
Typical material combinations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a gallium arsenide (GaAs) wafer, a Bragg mirror with AlAs and GaAs can be grown, if the <a href="photons.html" title="photons: quanta of light energy">photon</a> energy of the laser radiation is below the bandgap of GaAs, so as to avoid absorption in the Bragg mirror.
The active region can then contain InGaAs (In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1&minus;x</sub>As) quantum wells, where the indium (In) content lowers the bandgap energy.
Such InGaAs layers are compressively strained, because InGaAs would naturally have a slightly larger lattice constant.
The quantum wells can be embedded in AlGaAs, and strain compensation (see below) is possible with additional layers e.g. of GaAs<sub>1&minus;x</sub>P<sub>x</sub>.
Such structures are suitable for emission wavelengths of e.g. 960 or 1030&nbsp;nm.</li>
<li>For significantly longer emission wavelengths (e.g. around 1.3 or 1.55&nbsp;&mu;m), InGaAs can no longer be used, because the strain would be too large with the required high indium content.
In such cases, GaInNAs quantum wells can be suitable, where the nitrogen content reduces the lattice constant.
VECSELs based on such dilute nitride materials have the potential for a similar performance to that with InGaAs, although the growth of quaternary materials tends to be more difficult.</li>
<li>Emission in the 1.5-&mu;m region is also possible with InGaAsP quantum wells and indium phosphide (InP) as the wafer material.
However, a good Bragg mirror is then more difficult to make.
The combination InP/InGaAlAs has a low refractive index contrast and therefore requires a large number of layer pairs, or possibly combination with a metallic (gold) layer.
It is also possible to fuse an InP-based quantum well gain region to a GaAs/AlAs Bragg mirror on a GaAs wafer, but the fabrication of such hybrid structures is difficult.</li>
<li>For still longer wavelengths of e.g. 2&nbsp;&mu;m, antimonide materials can be used [22].
The quantum wells may be made from GaInSb (gallium indium antimonide).
Such structures can be grown on GaSb (gallium antimonide) wafers.</li>
<li>For emission around 850&nbsp;nm, GaAs quantum wells are suitable.
Then, however, GaAs cannot be contained in the Bragg mirror, because the mirror should not be absorbing.
One then has to resort to an AlAs/AlGaAs Bragg mirror, the latter with an aluminum content high enough to obtain a large enough bandgap.
The refractive index contrast is then reduced, but normally still sufficient.</li>
<li>Still shorter emission wavelengths in the <a href="red_lasers.html" title="red lasers: lasers emitting red light">red</a> spectral region, such as 610 or 650&nbsp;nm, can be realized with GaInP quantum wells between AlGaInP barriers.
The shorter the wavelength, the lower the possible index contrast of the Bragg mirror, which can cause problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quantum wells are usually placed such that each one is in an anti-node of the electric field distribution for the lasing wavelength.
This configuration is sometimes called <em>resonant periodic gain</em>, although this wording is somewhat inappropriate, since the periodic placement of quantum wells has no relation to a resonance (even if the structure may be resonant in addition).
As other wavelengths have a different standing-wave period, their field distributions will overlap less perfectly with the quantum wells (<em>lower confinement factor</em>), so that the effective <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> is reduced.</p>
<p>The number of quantum wells used in such a structure can vary.
A larger number may result in a higher <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, but also in a thicker gain structure with a higher sensitivity to growth errors, strain and temperature effects (see below).
Also, some considerable degree of <a href="inhomogeneous_saturation.html" title="inhomogeneous saturation: gain saturation effects which alter the shape of the gain spectrum">inhomogeneous gain saturation</a> can occur as a result of both the internal temperature gradients and different excitation levels of the quantum wells.
This can be a problem e.g. in narrow-<a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> or <a href="mode_locking.html" title="mode locking: a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode-locked</a> operation.</p>
<p>Temperature changes affect both the wavelength of maximum intrinsic gain of the quantum wells and the field distribution.
As some degree of heating is unavoidable, gain structures should be designed so that an optimum match of all parameters is achieved at the expected operating temperature, rather than at room temperature.
Designs which are non-ideal in this respect may exhibit a serious power reduction (roll-over) for too high pump powers.</p>
<p>Another important issue is the influence on the strain in VECSEL gain structures, which results from the lattice mismatch particularly between the quantum wells and the other layers.
For example, InGaAs quantum wells in a GaAs-based VECSEL structure are subject to compressive strain, because their natural lattice constant would be slightly larger than that of GaAs.
By incorporating some additional layers with a smaller lattice constant and appropriate thickness, <em>strain compensation</em> occurs in the sense that the overall compressive and tensile strain are balanced.
(The compressive strain within the quantum wells remains, of course, and can even have beneficial effects in terms of higher optical <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> and efficiency.)
Even when strain-compensating layers are used, it is not easy to avoid strain-related defects entirely, which occur e.g. in the form of <em>dark lines</em> where the <a href="photoluminescence.html" title="photoluminescence: emission of light which is caused by the irradiation of a material with other light">photoluminescence</a> is quenched.
(Lattice defects have the tendency to propagate along certain crystal directions.)
During laser operation, involving significant temperature gradients, such defects can accumulate and lead to rapid device degradation.
The development and reliable fabrication of high-power VECSEL gain structures with long lifetime is certainly a difficult task.</p>
<p>The following section discusses additional details related to optical pumping.</p>
<p>Overall, the design (and of course the growth) of VECSEL gain structures is a sophisticated issue, where many factors have to be taken into account to reach satisfactory performance.
Gain structures for mode-locked operation (see below) involve additional design details related to <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>, which can strongly affect the pulse shaping process.
A good understanding of all these factors and the use of flexible design software are essential for finding good designs.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">In-well Pumping Versus Spacer Pumping</h2>
<div>
<p>Due to the small thickness of the <a href="quantum_wells.html" title="quantum wells: thin layers confining carriers in one dimension">quantum wells</a> in the gain region of a VECSEL, <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="pump absorption: the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> is not particularly efficient if it occurs only in the quantum wells.
Therefore, the usual approach is to design the gain structure such that the spacer layers between the quantum wells also absorb pump radiation.
The carriers generated in these layers can be efficiently transferred to the quantum wells, as these have a smaller bandgap than the spacer layers.
However, efficient carrier transfer requires that the bandgaps of both materials are sufficiently different, and thus that the pump wavelength is substantially shorter than the laser wavelength.
This increases the <a href="quantum_defect.html" title="quantum defect: energy difference between pump and laser photons">quantum defect</a> and thus the dissipated power.</p>
<p>An alternative is <em>in-well pumping</em>, i.e. directly pumping the quantum wells [13].
Efficient pump absorption may then still be achieved by using a multipass pumping scheme, much as in a solid-state <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="thin-disk lasers: solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk laser</a>.
However, this adds to the complexity of the setup and also introduces more stringent conditions on the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="optical spectrum: the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> of the pump radiation.
It is therefore not clear whether this approach is sufficiently practical for widespread application.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Intracavity Frequency Doubling</h2>
<div>
<p>As a VECSEL is a low-gain laser, its intracavity power is far higher than the output power.
This is advantageous for <a href="intracavity_frequency_doubling.html" title="intracavity frequency doubling: frequency doubling with a nonlinear crystal within the laser resonator">intracavity frequency doubling</a>, i.e. inserting a <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="nonlinear crystal materials: crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal</a> into the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>.
In this way, watt-level <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="continuous-wave operation: operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> devices can exhibit efficient <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="nonlinear frequency conversion: the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a>.
This allows the construction of efficient <a href="red_lasers.html" title="red lasers: lasers emitting red light">red</a>, <a href="green_lasers.html" title="green lasers: lasers emitting in the green spectral region">green</a> and <a href="blue_lasers.html" title="blue lasers: lasers emitting blue light">blue</a> laser sources, with possible applications e.g. in <a href="rgb_sources.html" title="RGB sources: source of red, green and blue light, which is usually provided in the form laser beams">RGB</a> laser projection displays.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Ultrashort Pulse Generation with Mode Locking</h2>
<div>
<p>The external cavities of VECSELs also allow for <a href="mode_locking.html" title="mode locking: a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode-locked</a> operation [2] with <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="pulse repetition rate: the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a> of typically a few gigahertz, but in some cases below 1&nbsp;GHz or far above 10&nbsp;GHz [15].
Particularly with passive mode locking of optically pumped VECSELs, utilizing a <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diode</a> as pump source and a <a href="semiconductor_saturable_absorber_mirrors.html" title="semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors: saturable semiconductor absorber devices acting as nonlinear mirrors">semiconductor saturable absorber mirror</a> (SESAM) in the external resonator for mode locking, tremendous progress has been achieved since the year 2000.
This lead to average output powers well exceeding 1&nbsp;W [4], i.e., being orders of magnitude higher than achievable with any other mode-locked semiconductor laser.
Typical <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="pulse duration: the duration of an optical pulse">pulse durations</a> are in the lower picosecond range, although durations well below 1&nbsp;ps have also been demonstrated [6,&thinsp;24].
The pulses are sometimes close to <a href="transform_limit.html" title="transform limit: a limit for the time&ndash;bandwidth&ndash;product of an optical pulse">transform limited</a>, but strongly <a href="chirp.html" title="chirp: time dependence of the instantaneous frequency of an optical pulse">chirped</a> in other cases, depending on details of <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> and other issues.</p>
<p>It has recently been demonstrated that passive mode locking is possible even with a <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="saturable absorbers: light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorber</a> integrated into the gain structure [17].
Such integrated structures are difficult to grow and are so far subject to serious performance limitations.
However, in the future they may allow the construction of very compact and potentially cheap mode-locked lasers [20].</p>
<p>Note that the details of pulse generation in VECSELs are substantially different from those of more conventional <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a> or <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>.
In particular, VECSELs exhibit a low <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="saturation energy: a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation fluence</a> and a low <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="upper-state lifetime: the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a>.
This allows for very high pulse repetition rates without <a href="q_switching_instabilities.html" title="Q-switching instabilities: instabilities of passively mode-locked lasers where the pulse energy is unstable">Q-switching instabilities</a>.
On the other hand, it is not possible to obtain high <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="pulse energy: energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a>, except for synchronous pumping with another mode-locked laser.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Future Potential</h2>
<div>
<p>VECSELs appear to have a huge potential for widespread application in various areas, because they combine several important features:</p>
<ul>
<li class="ta_left">wavelength versatility</li>
<li class="ta_left">potential for high output power</li>
<li class="ta_left">high beam quality</li>
<li class="ta_left">potentially cheap mass production</li>
</ul>
<p>The last mentioned advantage results from the fact that VECSEL gain structures can be fabricated with a wafer technology, where hundreds or thousands of devices are grown on a single wafer.</p>
<p>These advantages make VECSELs particularly interesting as parts of <a href="rgb_sources.html" title="RGB sources: source of red, green and blue light, which is usually provided in the form laser beams">RGB sources</a> for digital laser projection displays.
The output powers required for consumer products can be generated with electrically pumped devices, further lowering the cost.
Large screen displays can still use optically pumped lasers.</p>
<p>VECSELs will replace many other <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> also in other application areas where special wavelengths (particularly short wavelengths) are required (see e.g. the article on <a href="visible_lasers.html" title="visible lasers: lasers (or other laser-based light sources) emitting visible light">visible lasers</a>).
They are also interesting candidates in cases where <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> are required, provided that one does not need high <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="pulse energy: energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a>.</p>
<p>Another application of VECSELs is <a href="intracavity_laser_absorption_spectroscopy.html" title="intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy: a method of laser spectroscopy, based on the evolution of the optical spectrum of intracavity radiation under the influence of narrowband absorption features">intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy</a>, relying on VECSEL chips which are optimized for a broad emission <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.</p>

<h2>Photonics in Times of Trouble for International Trade</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px;">This <a href="spotlight_2017_02_17c8d6.html?banner=International_trade">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> addresses the current serious concerns about the future of international trade and more generally international cooperation. Some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>German trade surplus</b> deserves attention, but claiming unfair practices without differentiating between different sectors of the economy is just stupid talk.</li>
<li>Already announced changes of US policy constitute a serious threat of beginning <b>trade wars</b>, which could have disastrous consequences.</li>
<li>There are also <b>ruthless attacks on essential values</b>, contributing to a breakdown of cooperation.</li>
<li>If we do not stop these developments in time, we may get into the <b>big crunch</b>.</li>
<li>We must <b>fiercely defend fundamental values</b> as well as <b>international cooperation</b>, because this is the only chance to solve a wide range of serious problems.</li>
</ul>
