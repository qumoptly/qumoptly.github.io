<p>An RGB source is a light source which emits at the same time red, green and blue light.
Such sources are required mainly for color display applications.
A wide range of colors can be obtained by mixing different amounts of red, green and blue light (<em>additive color mixing</em>).
A possible combination of <a href="wavelength.html" title="wavelength: the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelengths</a> is 630&nbsp;nm for red, 532&nbsp;nm for green, and 465&nbsp;nm for blue light.</p>
<p>Many currently used projection displays (&ldquo;beamers&rdquo;) are based on an arc lamp, combined with various color <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">filters</a>.
While an arc lamp is much cheaper than a <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> source of comparable output power, it does not allow for a high <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="wall-plug efficiency: total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">wall-plug efficiency</a>, it has a limited lifetime, and the poor spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="coherence: a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> of the output imposes restrictions on the achievable image quality.
Also, the available color space is not very large.
Therefore, laser sources are under investigation that could offer a wider color space, much better spatial coherence (<a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>), and higher power efficiency.
Such RGB laser sources emit light in the form of <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a> &ndash; either one beam for each color, or all colors combined in one beam.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Color Perception and the Chromaticity Diagram</h2>
<div>
<p>Color perception is not just an issue of physics, but depends on the workings of our eyes.
The retina of the human eye contains just three different receptors with different sensitivity to light at different wavelengths.
(There is actually a fourth kind of receptor with yet another spectral response curve, but this is used only for vision at very low light levels.)
The perception of colors is based on registering the relative strength of excitation of the three types of receptors.
Therefore, the perceived colors are projected to an only three-dimensional space.
(Most mammals actually use only two different color receptors, shrinking the color perception even to two dimensions.)
As a result, all perceived colors can be located in a two-dimensional chromaticity diagram as shown in Figure&nbsp;1, if the possibility of varying the optical intensity of each color is ignored.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/cie1931.png" alt="chromaticity diagram according to CIE 1931">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Chromaticity diagram according to CIE 1931. Monochromatic light with different wavelengths corresponds to the edge of the colored area (wavelength values in nanometers are indicated). Of course, the colors can not be correctly reproduced, because no screen and no printer can reproduce the whole range of colors.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the case of <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>-based RGB sources, the red, green and blue beams usually have a relatively narrow optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>, i.e. they are close to monochromatic.
In the chromaticity diagram, such beams are associated with points at the border of the colored region.
By mixing, e.g., three monochromatic beams, all those colors can be reproduced which lie in the triangle spanned by the corresponding points.
For comparison, the accessible color range for a cathode tube display, a lamp-based beamer or a color printer is a triangle with the edges lying well inside the diagram, so that the spanned area is usually much smaller.
A significant further improvement of a laser-based projection system would be to add a fourth wavelength.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Color Rendering and Luminous Efficiency</h2>
<div>
<p>The choice of the three wavelengths of an RGB source determines the so-called <em>color rendering index</em> (CRI), which is a quantitative measure of how well it is possible to judge the color of objects when these are illuminated with white light consisting (in our case) of the three spectral components.
Further, the choice of wavelengths influences the possible <em>luminous efficiency</em> (also called <em>efficacy</em>) of the source, and the two aspects can be in conflict with each other.
For example, a long wavelength of the red beam is favorable in terms of color rendering, but tends to diminish the luminous efficiency because the human eye's sensitivity drops rapidly with increasing wavelength in that region.</p>
<p>The reason why good color rendering is more difficult with pigments (e.g. of paints, dyes, or inks) than with laser beams is essentially that pigments work on the basis of <em>subtractive color mixing</em>, and this approach does not allow the combination of relatively bright colors with narrow optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidths</a>: if a pigment were to generate a very &ldquo;pure&rdquo; color (close to monochromatic light), it would have to absorb all light outside a narrow wavelength band, and leave only a tiny portion of the incident <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>.
Conversely, a bright yellow pigment, for example, has to transmit not only yellow, but also a lot of red, orange and green light, as it could otherwise not look bright.
Such a mixture of different wavelengths, however, cannot correspond to a point in the color diagram which is close to the boundary, where the monochromatic beams are located.</p>
<p>Note that the availability of a practical laser-based RGB source would not automatically make it possible to realize projection displays for entertainment with a faithful color rendering in a very wide color space.
Video material covering that wide color space would also be required.
Currently used videos are based on a smaller color gamut, so that color information is lost.
The small color gamut of the video may be transformed into a larger gamut for the display, but in that case the color rendering will not be faithful.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Required Power Level and Beam Quality</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> below 1&nbsp;W per color are sufficient for indoor digital projection displays (with not too much ambient light) with a projection area of up to a few square meters.
For hand-held devices, even a few tens of milliwatts are sufficient, although higher power levels are desirable for operation under non-optimum ambient light conditions.
Cinema projectors require 10&nbsp;W per color or more.
Suitable projector technology exists, but the RGB sources have not yet reached sufficient power, maturity and cost effectiveness, e.g. for application in cinemas.
A smaller market with lower sensitivity to cost is the area of flight simulators.</p>
<p>In most cases, RGB sources need to have a reasonable or even good <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, e.g. if the display contains a projector which scans the displayed pixels point by point; here, a sufficiently small pixel size (for high resolution) requires a high beam quality.
For other projector types, the beam quality demands may be lower.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">RGB Sources for Stereo Vision</h2>
<div>
<p>There are special RGB sources which can be used for stereoscopic displays, called 6P RGB sources.
For each of the red, green and blue colors, they have two spectral components which differ in wavelength e.g. by 20&nbsp;nm.
For viewing, one can then use special filter glasses which transmit only one set of wavelengths (R1, G1, B1) for the left eye and another set (R2, G2, B2) for the right eye.
That way, one can produce independent images for the two eyes.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Power Modulation</h2>
<div>
<p>Depending on the type of projector engine, the three components of an RGB source may or may not have to be power-modulated according to the video signal.
Power modulation is most often needed in case of scanning projectors, particularly in the context of low-power miniature devices, where the use of external <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="optical modulators: devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">optical modulators</a> is not practical.
The modulation <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> required is typically in the region of tens of megahertz or (for higher resolution) even &gt;&thinsp;100&nbsp;MHz.
This is possible when <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> are used, but not when <a href="doped_insulator_lasers.html" title="doped insulator lasers: lasers with a solid-state gain medium containing a laser-active dopant">doped insulator</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> are involved.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Types of Laser-based RGB Sources</h2>
<div>
<p>Different approaches can be taken to construct RGB sources.
One possibility is to use three lasers, each emitting light with the wanted color.
The problem is, however, that <a href="visible_lasers.html" title="visible lasers: lasers (or other laser-based light sources) emitting visible light">visible lasers</a> are severely limited in performance compared with their near-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="infrared light: invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> counterparts.
At least a few hundred milliwatts of nearly diffraction-limited output, which would be sufficient for not too large indoor projection displays, can be generated with red and blue <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a>, whereas there is unfortunately no green laser diode with similar performance and a sufficiently long lifetime.
Therefore, the green light usually has to be generated by <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="frequency doubling: the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doubling</a> the output of a <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="YAG lasers: lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG</a> or <a href="vanadate_lasers.html" title="vanadate lasers: lasers based on rare-earth-doped yttrium, gadolinium or lutetium vanadate crystals, usually Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>">Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> laser</a> emitting at 1064&nbsp;nm.
<a href="intracavity_frequency_doubling.html" title="intracavity frequency doubling: frequency doubling with a nonlinear crystal within the laser resonator">Intracavity frequency-doubled</a> <a href="vertical_external_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="vertical external-cavity surface-emitting lasers: surface-emitting semiconductor lasers with an external laser resonator">VECSELs</a> and devices with single-pass doubling in a <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> are also attracting increasing interest for that purpose, because they have the potential for cost-effective mass production.</p>
<p>For higher power levels of multiple watts, the red and blue light also have to be generated in other ways, usually with one or several <a href="infrared_light.html" title="infrared light: invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> and some kind of <a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="nonlinear frequency conversion: the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">nonlinear frequency conversion</a> in <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="nonlinear crystal materials: crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystals</a>.
It is possible to start with a single near-infrared laser and generate all three colors through a combination of nonlinear frequency conversion stages.
For example, one may start at 1064&nbsp;nm, generate the 532-nm green light by frequency doubling, use part of it to pump an <a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="optical parametric oscillators: coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">optical parametric oscillator</a> emitting a signal e.g. at 631&nbsp;nm (red output) and an idler at 920&nbsp;nm.
The latter can be frequency doubled to obtain blue light at 460&nbsp;nm.
There are, however, many other schemes, involving different combinations of parametric oscillators, frequency doublers, <a href="sum_and_difference_frequency_generation.html" title="sum and difference frequency generation: nonlinear processes generating beams with the sum or difference of the frequencies of the input beams">sum frequency mixers</a>, and the like.
The evaluation and comparison of such conversion schemes are a complex task, since the performance of the different nonlinear conversion stages depends not only on the crystal materials but also on optical <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">(peak) powers</a>, <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="pulse duration: the duration of an optical pulse">pulse durations</a>, and <a href="phase_matching.html" title="phase matching: a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase-matching</a> issues.</p>

<h2>Numerical Modeling</h2>
<p>Developing devices or systems in photonics requires a <b>comprehensive quantitative understanding</b> &ndash; otherwise, it becomes inefficient, waisting time and money.</p>
<p><a href="laser_modelinge50a.html?banner=numerical_modeling">Numerical modeling</a> is often the most efficient way towards results:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand <em>quantitatively</em> what is going on</li>
<li>check the influence of design changes or possible detrimental effects</li>
<li>understand strange experimental observations</li>
<li>find optimized designs more reliably and faster</li>
</ul>
