<p>(British spelling: fibres)</p>
<p>Optical fibers are the core components of <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="fiber optics: optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a>.
They are a kind of <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a>, which are usually made of some kind of glass, can potentially be very long (hundreds of kilometers), and are &ndash; in contrast to other waveguides &ndash; fairly flexible.</p>
<p>The most commonly used glass is <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica</a> (quartz glass, amorphous silicon dioxide = SiO<sub>2</sub>), either in pure form or with some dopants.
Silica is so widely used because of its outstanding properties, in particular its potential for extremely low propagation losses (realized with ultrapure material) and its amazingly high mechanical strength against pulling and even bending (provided that the surfaces are well prepared).
However, for some special applications one requires <a href="specialty_fibers.html" title="specialty fibers: optical fibers with special designs or materials">specialty fibers</a> made from other types of glasses, e.g. fluoride fibers (see below).</p>
<p>Most optical fibers used in laser technology have a <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> with a <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> which is somewhat higher than that of the surrounding medium (called the <em>cladding</em>).
The simplest case is that of a <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="step-index fibers: optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile"><em>step-index fiber</em></a>, where the refractive index is constant within the core and within the cladding.
The index contrast between core and cladding determines the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> of the fiber (see below), and is typically small, so that optical fibers are weakly guiding.
Light launched into the core is guided along the core, i.e., it propagates mainly in the core region, although the intensity distribution may extend somewhat beyond the core.
Due to the guidance and the low propagation losses, the optical intensity can be maintained over long lengths of fiber.</p>
<p>Although most optical fibers have only a single core, there are also so-called <a href="multi_core_fibers.html" title="multi-core fibers: optical fibers containing more than one fiber core">multi-core fibers</a> containing a few cores or even a large number of those.</p>
<p>A less frequently used principle of guiding light is based on a photonic bandgap (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="photonic_bandgap_fibers.html" title="photonic bandgap fibers: optical fibers where light is guided based on a photonic bandgap effect"><em>photonic bandgap fibers</em></a>).
For example, this can be realized with concentric rings of different refractive index, forming a kind of two-dimensional <a href="bragg_mirrors.html" title="Bragg mirrors: mirror structures based on Bragg reflection at a period structure">Bragg mirror</a>.</p>

The light propagates along the core and leaves the other fiber end as a divergent beam.
The fiber core and cladding are made of glass.

<p>The term <a href="specialty_fibers.html" title="specialty fibers: optical fibers with special designs or materials"><em>specialty fibers</em></a> is used for many different kinds of optical fibers with special properties, and is thus not very specific.
Such fibers may be based on unusual glasses or just have unusual designs.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Applications of Optical Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>There are many important applications of <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="fiber optics: optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a>.
Some of the most important ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">Optical fiber communications</a> utilize optical fibers mostly for long-range data transmission, but sometimes also for short distances.
Huge amounts of data can be quickly sent through a single fiber, which is also immune to external influences such as electric and magnetic fields.</li>
<li>Active fiber-optic devices contain some <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fiber</a>.
<a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">Fiber lasers</a> can generate <a href="laser_light.html" title="laser light: light generated with a laser device">laser light</a> at various wavelengths, and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> can be used e.g. for boosting the optical power or amplifying some weak signals.</li>
<li><a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="fiber-optic sensors: optical sensors based on fiber devices">Fiber-optic sensors</a> can be used e.g. for distributed temperature and strain measurements in buildings, oil pipelines, and wings of airplanes.</li>
<li>Passive optical fibers [14] are useful for transporting light from some source to another point, e.g. for purposes like illumination, <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="diode-pumped lasers: solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode pumping of lasers</a> and <a href="power_over_fiber.html" title="power over fiber: delivery of power for electronic devices via light in an optical fiber">power over fiber</a>.
Also, they are used for connecting components in fiber-optic devices, such as <a href="interferometers.html" title="interferometers: optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometers</a> and <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>.
They then play a similar role as electrical wires do in electronic devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="fiber optics: optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a> has become a particularly important area within the technology of <a href="photonics.html" title="photonics: the science and technology of light">photonics</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Modes &ndash; Single-mode versus Multimode Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>A optical fiber can support one or several (sometimes even many) <em>guided <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a></em>, the intensity distributions of which are located at or immediately around the fiber core, although some of the intensity may propagate within the fiber cladding.
In addition, there is a multitude of <a href="cladding_modes.html" title="cladding modes: modes in optical fibers (or other waveguides) which are not restricted to the region around the core">cladding modes</a>, which are not restricted to the core region.
The optical power in cladding modes is usually lost after some moderate distance of propagation, but can in some cases propagate over longer distances.
Outside the cladding, there is typically a protective polymer coating, which gives the fiber improved mechanical strength and protection against moisture, and also determines the losses for cladding modes.
Such buffer coatings may consist of acrylate, silicone or polyimide, for example.
At the fiber ends, the coating often has to be stripped off.</p>
<p>An important distinction is that between single-mode and multimode fibers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">Single-mode fibers</a> usually have a relatively small core (with a diameter of only a few micrometers) and can guide only a single spatial <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">mode</a> (disregarding the fact that there are two different polarization directions), the profile of which in most cases has roughly a Gaussian shape.
Changing the launch conditions only affects the power launched into the guided mode, whereas the spatial distribution of the light exiting the fiber is fixed.
Efficiently launching light into a single-mode fiber usually requires a laser source with good <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and precise alignment of the focusing optics in order to achieve <a href="mode_matching.html" title="mode matching: the precise spatial matching of the electric field distributions of laser beams and resonator modes or waveguide modes">mode matching</a>.
The <a href="mode_radius.html" title="mode radius: a measure of the transverse extent of a laser mode or laser beam">mode radius</a> of a single-mode fiber is often of the order of 5&nbsp;&mu;m, but there are also <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fibers</a> with single-mode guidance.
In the latter case, the alignment tolerances are lower in terms of position but higher in terms of angle (which may be less problematic).</li>
<li><a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">Multimode fibers</a> have a larger core and/or a larger index difference between core and cladding, so that they support multiple modes with different intensity distributions (Figure&nbsp;3).
In this case, the spatial profile of light exiting the fiber core depends on the launch conditions, which determine the distribution of power among the spatial modes.</li>
</ul>
<figure>

<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
Electric near field amplitude profiles for all the guided modes of a <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> with a top-hat refractive index profile (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="step-index fibers: optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile"><em>step index fiber</em></a>). The two colors indicate different signs of electric field values.
The lowest-order mode (<i>l</i>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0, <i>m</i>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1, called <a href="lp_modes.html" title="LP modes: linearly polarized modes of optical fibers with radially symmetric index profiles in the approximation of weak guidance">LP<sub>01</sub> mode</a>) has an intensity profile which is similar to that of a <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="Gaussian beams: light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a>.
In general, light launched into a <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fiber</a> will excite a superposition of different modes, which can have a complicated shape.

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Long-range <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communication</a> systems usually use single-mode fibers, because the different <a href="group_velocity.html" title="group velocity: the velocity with which the envelope of a weak narrow-band optical pulse propagates in a medium">group velocities</a> of different modes would distort the signal at high data rates (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="intermodal_dispersion.html" title="intermodal dispersion: the phenomenon that the group velocity of light propagating in a waveguide structure depends on the waveguide mode">intermodal dispersion</a>).
For shorter distances, however, multimode fibers are more convenient as the demands on light sources and component alignment are lower.
Therefore, local area networks (LANs), except those for highest bandwidth, normally use multimode fiber.</p>
<p>Single-mode fibers are also normally used for <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">amplifiers</a>.
Multimode fibers are often used, e.g., for the transport of light from a laser source to the place where it is needed, particularly when the light source has a poor <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and/or the high optical power requires a large <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">mode area</a>.</p>
<p>Different modes of an optical fiber can be coupled via various effects, e.g. by bending or often by irregularities in the refractive index profile.
These may be unwanted or purposely introduced, e.g. as <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a>.
<a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">Waveguide</a> theory shows that an important factor for the coupling between different fiber modes is the difference in their <a href="wavenumber.html" title="wavenumber: the phase delay per unit length, or that quantity divided by 2&pi;">wavenumbers</a>, which for efficient coupling has to match the spatial frequency of a coupling disturbance.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Main Parameters</h2>
<div>
<p>The design of a <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="step-index fibers: optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index fiber</a> can be characterized with only two parameters, e.g. the core radius <span class="eqn_il"><i>a</i></span> and the refractive index difference <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&Delta;</span><i>n</i></span> between core and cladding.
Typical values of the core radius are a few microns for single-mode fibers and tens of microns or more for multimode fibers.</p>
<p>Instead of the refractive index difference, one usually uses the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>, defined as</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/na_def.gif" width="180" height="45" alt="numerical aperture"></div>
<p>which is the sine of the maximum acceptable angle of an incident beam with respect to the fiber axis (considering the launch from air into the core in a ray-optic picture).
(<span class="eqn_il"><i>n</i><sub>0</sub></span> is the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> of the surrounding medium &ndash; close to 1 in case of air.)
The NA also quantifies the strength of guidance.
Typical values are of the order of 0.1 for single-mode fibers, even though actual values vary in a relatively large range.
For example, <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area</a> single-mode fibers can have low numerical apertures below 0.05, whereas some <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a> have values of 0.3 and higher for a high <a href="gain_efficiency.html" title="gain efficiency: small-signal gain of an optical amplifier per unit pump power or per unit stored energy">gain efficiency</a>.
NA values around 0.3 are typical for multimode fibers.
The sensitivity of a fiber to <a href="bend_losses.html" title="bend losses: propagation losses in an optical fiber (or other waveguide) caused by bending">bend losses</a> strongly diminishes with increasing NA, which causes strong confinement of the mode field to the core.</p>
<p>Another frequently used parameter is the <a href="v_number.html" title="V number: a normalized frequency parameter, which determines the number of modes of a step-index fiber"><i>V</i> number</a></p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/v_number.gif" width="256" height="41" alt="V number"></div>
<p>which is a kind of normalized frequency.
Single-mode guidance is achieved when the <span class="eqn_il"><i>V</i></span> number is below &asymp;&thinsp;2.405.
Multimode fibers can have huge <span class="eqn_il"><i>V</i></span> values.
The number of modes then scales with <span class="eqn_il"><i>V</i><sup>2</sup></span>.</p>
<p>As a numerical example, consider a typical step-index <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fiber</a> for single-mode operation in the 1.5-&mu;m spectral region, with a <a href="cut_off_wavelength.html" title="cut-off wavelength: a wavelength above which a guided mode of a waveguide ceases to exist">cut-off wavelength</a> of 1.3&nbsp;&mu;m and a numerical aperture of 0.1.
The refractive index of the pure silica cladding at 1.5&nbsp;&mu;m is &asymp;&thinsp;1.444.
The core index is &asymp;&thinsp;1.4475, i.e., the index difference is &asymp;&thinsp;0.0035.
The core diameter is 10&nbsp;&mu;m, and the <span class="eqn_il"><i>V</i></span> number is 2.1.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Refractive Index Profiles</h2>
<div>
<p>The refractive index profile of optical fibers often deviates substantially from that of a step-index profile (with constant refractive index within the core):</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to preferential evaporation of the dopant during the collapse of the preform (assuming that the preform is made with chemical vapor deposition, see below), there is often a pronounced index dip at the center.
For single-mode fibers with small mode areas, this does not need to have a strong impact on the mode field distribution, which in most cases closely resembles a Gaussian shape.</li>
<li>Some fibers are made with graded index profiles (<em>graded-index fibers</em>) where the refractive index is gradually reduced away from the center, e.g. with a parabolic shape.
Parabolic index profiles are useful e.g. for multimode fibers because they minimize <a href="intermodal_dispersion.html" title="intermodal dispersion: the phenomenon that the group velocity of light propagating in a waveguide structure depends on the waveguide mode">intermodal dispersion</a> (see below).</li>
<li>There are also &ldquo;W profiles&rdquo;, where the core is surrounded by a region with a refractive index lower than that of the cladding (<em>depressed cladding</em>).
In principle, there can even be additional index steps, or combinations with smooth refractive index variations.</li>
<li>Triangular, trapezoidal and Gaussian index profiles are used for <a href="dispersion_shifted_fibers.html" title="dispersion-shifted fibers: fibers with a non-standard zero dispersion wavelength">dispersion-shifted fibers</a>.</li>
<li>Index profiles do not need to be cylindrical.
For example, an elliptical core shape can provide increased <a href="birefringence.html" title="birefringence: the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="polarization-maintaining fibers: specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam"><em>polarization-maintaining fibers</em></a>) or even single-polarization guidance (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="single_polarization_fibers.html" title="single-polarization fibers: optical fibers which transmit only light with a certain polarization"><em>single-polarization fibers</em></a>) (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the definitions of the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> and consequently of the <i>V</i>&thinsp;number become somewhat ambiguous for non-rectangular index profiles.</p>
<p>In addition, there are so-called <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="photonic crystal fibers: specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a> (see below), where the refractive index profile is strongly structured.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Propagation Losses</h2>
<div>
<p>The power losses for light propagating in an optical fiber can be extremely small, particularly for <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a> <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a> as used in telecommunications.
The resulting attenuation is typically dominated by <a href="rayleigh_scattering.html" title="Rayleigh scattering: scattering of light at scattering centers which are much smaller than the wavelength">Rayleigh scattering</a> for short wavelengths and by <a href="multiphonon_absorption.html" title="multiphonon absorption: absorption processes involving multiple phonons">multiphonon absorption</a> at long wavelengths.
Rayleigh scattering results from refractive index fluctuations, which are to some extent unavoidable in a glass, but can be strongly increased by concentration fluctuations in fibers with high <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>.
Other loss contributions come from inelastic scattering (spontaneous <a href="brillouin_scattering.html" title="Brillouin scattering: a nonlinear scattering effect involving acoustic phonons">Brillouin scattering</a> and <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="Raman scattering: a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman scattering</a>), from absorbing impurities, and from fluctuations of the core diameter.</p>
<p>For silica fibers, the loss minimum occurs around 1.5&ndash;1.6&nbsp;&mu;m and can be below 0.2&nbsp;<a href="decibel.html" title="decibel: a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">dB</a>/km (&asymp;&thinsp;4.5&#37; per km), which is close to the theoretical limit based on <a href="rayleigh_scattering.html" title="Rayleigh scattering: scattering of light at scattering centers which are much smaller than the wavelength">Rayleigh scattering</a> in an amorphous glass material.
There is often some loss peak around 1.4&nbsp;&mu;m, which can be largely eliminated, however, by carefully optimizing the chemical composition of the core so as to reduce the OH content (i.e. the concentration of hydroxyl bonds).
Interestingly, fibers with high OH content can exhibit lower losses for <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="ultraviolet light: invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a>, whereas they exhibit pronounced loss peaks in the <a href="infrared_light.html" title="infrared light: invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> spectral region.</p>
<p><a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">Multimode fibers</a>, and in general fibers with high <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>, tend to have significantly higher propagation losses, essentially because the higher doping level of the core increases the scattering losses.
<a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">Rare-earth-doped fibers</a> also have much higher losses, but as more than some tens of meters of such a fiber are rarely used, this usually does not matter for their applications.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Polarization Properties</h2>
<div>
<p>Despite the typically cylindrical symmetry, fibers usually exhibit some amount of <a href="birefringence.html" title="birefringence: the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a> which can cause the polarization state of light to evolve in an uncontrolled way (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam"><em>polarization of laser emission</em></a>).
There are special <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="polarization-maintaining fibers: specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining fibers</a> with a strong built-in <a href="birefringence.html" title="birefringence: the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a> to solve this problem.
In addition, there are <a href="single_polarization_fibers.html" title="single-polarization fibers: optical fibers which transmit only light with a certain polarization">single-polarization fibers</a>, which guide only light with one polarization direction.
There are also various types of <a href="fiber_polarization_controllers.html" title="fiber polarization controllers: devices which allow one to control the state of polarization of light within fibers">fiber polarization controllers</a>, which allow one to adjust the state of polarization in a fiber.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Dispersion Properties</h2>
<div>
<p>As a result of the <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> properties, the <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> of an optical fiber can deviate significantly from its material dispersion, particularly when the mode area is small (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="waveguide_dispersion.html" title="waveguide dispersion: chromatic dispersion arising from waveguiding effects"><em>waveguide dispersion</em></a>).
This makes it possible to obtain unusual dispersion properties by engineering the waveguide properties.
For example, <a href="dispersion_shifted_fibers.html" title="dispersion-shifted fibers: fibers with a non-standard zero dispersion wavelength">dispersion-shifted fibers</a> can have near zero dispersion in the 1.5-&mu;m spectral region, and there are <a href="dispersion_shifted_fibers.html" title="dispersion-shifted fibers: fibers with a non-standard zero dispersion wavelength">dispersion-flattened fibers</a> with small dispersion over a large wavelength range or <a href="dispersion_decreasing_fibers.html" title="dispersion-decreasing fibers: optical fibers where the chromatic dispersion changes monotonously along the propagation direction">dispersion-decreasing fibers</a>.
A particularly high design freedom exists for <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="photonic crystal fibers: specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a> (see below).</p>
<p>The <a href="birefringence.html" title="birefringence: the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a> makes the <a href="group_delay.html" title="group delay: a measure of the time delay experienced by narrow-band light pulses in an optical device">group delay</a> polarization-dependent; this is often called <em>polarization mode dispersion</em>.
For <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>, there is also <a href="intermodal_dispersion.html" title="intermodal dispersion: the phenomenon that the group velocity of light propagating in a waveguide structure depends on the waveguide mode">intermodal dispersion</a>, i.e., a dependence of the <a href="group_velocity.html" title="group velocity: the velocity with which the envelope of a weak narrow-band optical pulse propagates in a medium">group velocity</a> on the fiber mode, which may be minimized by choosing a suitable refractive index profile but is typically larger than the dispersion of single-mode fibers.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Fabrication</h2>
<div>
<p>Most optical fibers are fabricated by pulling from a so-called <em>preform</em>, which is a glass rod with a diameter of a few centimeters and roughly 1&nbsp;m length.
Along its axis, the preform contains a region with increased refractive index, which will form the <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a>.
When the preform is heated close to the melting point in a furnace (oven), a thin fiber with a diameter of typically 125&nbsp;&mu;m and a length of many kilometers can be pulled from the bottom of the preform.
Before the fiber is wound up, it usually obtains a polymer buffer coating for mechanical and chemical protection.</p>
<p>The core of a fiber can be <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="doping concentration: the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doped</a> with laser-active ions, normally <a href="rare_earth_doped_gain_media.html" title="rare-earth-doped gain media: laser gain media which are doped with rare earth ions">rare earth ions</a> of <a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="erbium-doped gain media: laser gain media doped with erbium ions">erbium</a>, <a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="neodymium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium</a>, <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="ytterbium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium</a>, or thulium.

<p>Glass fibers are amazingly robust, considering that glass is known as a particularly fragile material.
However, additional protection is often required when fibers are used in an environment which is e.g. accessible by operators.
For laboratory use, e.g. for sending light from a telecom setup to some diagnostic instrument and also in large industrial assemblies, it is convenient to use <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="fiber connectors: connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">connectorized</a> fiber cables (<em>fiber patchcords</em>, see Figure&nbsp;5), where the actual fiber is surrounded by additional protective layers.
While the bare glass fiber may have a typical diameter of 125&nbsp;&mu;m, and the polymer buffer and jacket increase this to a few hundred micrometers, the total diameter of the fiber cable may be several millimeters.
Apart from considerably strengthening the cable, the (typically yellow) cable material also makes it much easier for operators to recognize the fiber, thus avoiding too harsh treatment in the first place.</p>
<p>Thicker fiber cables are used for the delivery of high-power beams, e.g. from <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled diode lasers</a> to a <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="laser_heads.html" title="laser heads: assemblies containing a mounted gain medium and means for pumping and cooling, or the complete optical parts of a laser, or assemblies for directing a laser beam to a workpiece">laser head</a> or to some material processing equipment.
For power levels of hundreds of watts to many kilowatts, the fiber cable may have a diameter of several centimeters.
High-power fiber cables may also contain sensors for detecting damage to the cable, so that the laser source can be immediately switched off when there is a risk that high-power laser radiation exits the cable at a damaged point.
Such precautions can be very important for <a href="laser_safety.html" title="laser safety: safety of the use of laser devices">laser safety</a>.</p>
<p>Fiber cables for long-haul <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> are also fairly thick, because they often have to pass through harsh environments and must be protected accordingly.
In extreme cases, such cables may be lying on the sea bed or are slightly buried there.
A high level of protection is required against the mechanical stress both during installation and at later times.</p>
<p>Of course, a fiber cable can contain multiple fibers.
In this way, the already huge data transmission capability of a single fiber can be multiplied to enormously high levels.</p>

<li><a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber couplers: fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">Fiber couplers</a> allow to couple light typically between two fibers, typically with the coupling coefficient depending on the optical wavelength.</li>

<li><a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">Fiber amplifiers</a> can amplify light in certain wavelength regions.</li>

<p><a href="fiber_collimators.html" title="fiber collimators: devices for collimating the light coming from a fiber, or for launching collimated light into the fiber">Fiber collimators</a> provide a connection between fiber optics and free-space optics.
Essentially, such a device contains a collimation <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a>, transforming the strongly divergent beam from a fiber end into a <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="collimated beams: laser beams with weak divergence">collimated beam</a>.
Finally, there are mechanical splices, providing semi-permanent connections between fibers.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Polishing, Cleaving, and Splicing</h2>
<div>
<p>Clean and smoothly shaped fiber ends can be produced with polishing techniques.
These can also be used to produce end faces which are not perpendicular to the fiber axis.
With a tilt angle of the order of 10&deg; (<em>angle polishing</em>), reflections from fiber ends can be effectively eliminated from the beam path, so that e.g. reflection-sensitive lasers are well protected.</p>
<p>A much faster technique for preparing fiber ends is <a href="cleaving_of_fibers.html" title="cleaving of fibers: preparing fiber ends with clean optical surfaces by controlled breaking"><em>cleaving</em></a>.
Here, one typically pulls the fiber while scratching it from a side, e.g. with a vibrating diamond blade.
This makes the fiber break with normally fairly smooth end faces &ndash; at least around the core region.
By twisting the fiber during this process, angle cleaves can be fabricated, but the results are less reproducible than for polishing techniques.</p>
<p>Optical fibers (particularly those made of silica) can also be <em>spliced</em> together.
One may use the technique of <a href="fusion_splicing_of_fibers.html" title="fusion splicing of fibers: a technique of making low-loss fiber joints by fusing fiber ends together">fusion splicing</a> for making permanent <a href="fiber_joints.html" title="fiber joints: permanent or removable connections between fiber ends">fiber joints</a>.
A simpler technique is <em>mechanical splicing</em>, where the fiber ends are firmly held together by some mechanical means, but not fused.
Here, however, the splice losses are typically higher, even when reduced with an index-matching gel between the surfaces.</p>
<p>There are also many types of <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="fiber connectors: connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connectors</a> which allow one to obtain good mechanical contact (as in a mechanical splice), but also to disconnect the fibers easily as required.</p>
<p>In general, the handling of fiber ends is fairly delicate, compared with the handling of electrical connections.
Apart from problems with dust, grease and the like, fiber ends are relatively sensitive and are easily scratched.
Their handling often requires very expensive equipment (e.g. high-quality fusion splicers), particularly when reliable results are required under field conditions, i.e., in a comparatively dirty environment.
On the other hand, a fair comparison with electrical cables has to take into account the much higher transmission capacity of a fiber.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Safety Issues</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="laser_safety.html" title="laser safety: safety of the use of laser devices">Laser safety</a> in terms of eye safety is a serious issue with high-power fiber devices.
Very harmful high-power light could exit a damage fiber cable; therefore, such cables must be well protected against damage and possibly monitored with built-in sensor systems.</p>
<p>In <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, the <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> levels are often small enough to avoid eye safety problems, particularly when using the eye-safe wavelength region around 1.5&nbsp;&mu;m.
However, dangerous power levels can sometimes occur, e.g. in cable TV applications, where a high-power amplifier creates sufficiently signal power for splitting signals into many fibers.</p>
<p>Another risk for eyes is not associated with laser radiation, but with the sharp scraps of fiber ends, as are obtained e.g. when <a href="cleaving_of_fibers.html" title="cleaving of fibers: preparing fiber ends with clean optical surfaces by controlled breaking">cleaving fibers</a>.
These scraps are extremely sharp, may be transported into eyes e.g. when they stick to a finger, and may also penetrate the skin.
They should also not be ingested.
For such reasons, one should carefully dispose fiber scraps into a properly marked container immediately when they occur, take precautions to make them well visible in the working area, and avoid any eating or drinking near the work area.</p>

The linear polarization of light is preserved provided that the initial polarization axis is aligned with a birefringent axis of the fiber.
In addition, there are also <a href="single_polarization_fibers.html" title="single-polarization fibers: optical fibers which transmit only light with a certain polarization"><em>single-polarization fibers</em></a> (<em>polarizing fibers</em>) where one polarization direction experiences strong losses.</p>

Such fibers typically consist only of a single material (usually silica), containing very small air holes with diameters well below 1&nbsp;&mu;m.
Fabrication of such fibers is possible by using preforms with holes, made e.g. by stacking capillary tubes.
By varying the arrangement of air holes, fibers with extremely different properties can be made, e.g.</p>

For pulses with higher peak intensity or fluence, it may then be necessary to use <a href="core_less_end_caps.html" title="core-less end caps: end pieces attached to fibers, containing no fiber core">core-less end caps</a> (Figure&nbsp;6).
Fiber surfaces become even more vulnerable if there is any dust.
Also, launching a high optical power into a fiber end can overheat the nearby polymer coating.</li>
<li>For not even very high average powers, initial damage of a fiber end can have the consequence of a <a href="fiber_fuse.html" title="fiber fuse: the effect that an optical fiber 'burns' from the output end under the influence of an intense laser beam launched into the other end">fiber fuse</a> propagating through the whole fiber in the backward direction.</li>
<li>For too high <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak powers</a>, <a href="self_focusing.html" title="self-focusing: focusing of a beam in a transparent medium, caused by the beam itself through a nonlinear process in the medium">self-focusing</a> can occur, which further increases the intensity and leads to immediate damage.
For <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>, this effect tends to occur above a threshold power of roughly 4&nbsp;MW, relatively independent of the mode area.</li>
<li>In high-gain <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> made with <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a>, <a href="parasitic_lasing.html" title="parasitic lasing: unwanted laser operation in a laser or amplifier device">parasitic lasing</a> can occur, followed by a kind of <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q-switching</a> effect which can destroy the fiber.</li>
<li>For a too high dissipated power per unit length, a fiber can become overheated.
This applies particularly to acrylate coatings.
Water cooling provides an efficient means to suppress such effects.</li>

<h2 class="togglediv">Comparison of Optical Fibers with Electric Cables</h2>
<div>
<p>In some technical areas, such as optical data transmission over long distances or between computer chips, optical fibers (or other <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a>) compete with electric cables.
Compared with the latter, they have a number of pronounced advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li class="ta_left">Fiber cables are much less heavy than electric cables.</li>
<li class="ta_left">The capacity of a fiber for <a href="optical_data_transmission.html" title="optical data transmission: the transmission of information using light beams, e.g. in fibers">optical data transmission</a> is orders of magnitude higher than for any electric cable.</li>
<li class="ta_left">The transmission losses of a fiber can be very low: well below 1&nbsp;dB/km for the optimum wavelengths, which are around 1.5&nbsp;&mu;m.</li>
<li class="ta_left">A large number of channels can be reamplified in a single <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a>, if required for very large transmission distances.</li>
<li class="ta_left">Optical data connections via fibers are comparatively hard to intercept and manipulate, which gives additional security even without using encryption techniques.
For very high security, <a href="quantum_cryptography.html" title="quantum cryptography: methods to encrypt information securely, relying on quantum-mechanical phenomena">quantum cryptography</a> can be used.</li>
<li class="ta_left">Fiber connections are immune to electromagnetic interference, problems with ground loops, and the like.</li>
<li class="ta_left">Fibers do not introduce fire hazards or the risk of triggering explosive substances (unless a fiber carrying a high optical power breaks).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, fibers also have their disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiber connections are comparatively sensitive and difficult to handle, particularly when <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a> are used.
Precise alignment and high cleanliness are required.
For such reasons, fiber connections are often only competitive if a high transmission <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> can be utilized.</li>
<li>Glass fibers may not be bent very tightly, because this can cause high <a href="bend_losses.html" title="bend losses: propagation losses in an optical fiber (or other waveguide) caused by bending">bend losses</a> or even breakage.
This can be a problem e.g. in the context of <a href="fiber_to_the_home.html" title="fiber to the home: the technology of providing data connections to private homes via optical fibers rather than electric cables">fiber-to-the-home</a> technologies.
Note, however, that <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a> are surprisingly robust against bending &ndash; much more than most other things made of glass.</li>
</ul>
