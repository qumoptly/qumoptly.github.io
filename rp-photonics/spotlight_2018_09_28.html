<p><a href="microchip_lasers.html" title="microchip lasers: solid-state lasers with a quasi-monolithic setup">Microchip lasers</a> are <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>, where the laser essentially consists only of a <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> having reflective <a href="dielectric_coatings.html" title="dielectric coatings: thin-film coatings made of transparent dielectric materials, e.g. for laser mirrors or anti-reflection coatings">dielectric coatings</a> on both end faces (see Figure&nbsp;1).
In some cases, there is a second crystal attached to the laser crystal, e.g. a <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="saturable absorbers: light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorber</a> crystal for passive <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a>.
<a href="optical_pumping.html" title="optical pumping: electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">Optical pumping</a> is usually done with a <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diode</a>.</p>
<p>Such lasers obviously have a very simple and compact setup, which is attractive for many applications where simplicity, robustness and low cost of interest.
However, despite their apparent simplicity, their operation principles are not as simple as those of many other <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="diode-pumped lasers: solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped lasers</a>.</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:203px;">

<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span>

</figure>
<p>In particular, it is interesting to consider the properties of the <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a> of such a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>.
Usually, the two reflecting end faces are flat, and you may wonder how a stable resonator should be formed that way.
Indeed, you usually get a stable resonator only due to side effects of the <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="optical pumping: electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">optical pumping</a> of the laser crystal.
In particular, the heating which results from the <a href="quantum_defect.html" title="quantum defect: energy difference between pump and laser photons">quantum defect</a> and additional deficiency of the power conversion generates a <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="thermal lensing: a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lens</a>, i.e., a focusing effect for the light going through the laser crystal.
In addition, you may have some amount of <a href="gain_guiding.html" title="gain guiding: guiding of light based on spatially inhomogeneous optical gain">gain guiding</a>, which can also influence the mode properties.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">An Example Case</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout green">Can we have a stable resonator for arbitrarily strong lensing??</aside>
<p>As an example, let us consider a microchip laser made from at 10&nbsp;mm long <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="YAG lasers: lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG</a> crystal.
Let us start with a very simplified model for its laser resonator, where we assume that the lensing effect is uniformly distributed over the whole crystal length, and gain guiding is ignored.
Interestingly, in that situation one finds that for a given total dioptric power of the thermal lens, the <a href="mode_radius.html" title="mode radius: a measure of the transverse extent of a laser mode or laser beam">mode radius</a> is always constant along the path through the crystal.
Further, the resonator is found to be stable even for arbitrarily strong thermal lensing!
That is surprising, since we know, for example, that the focusing action of the curved end mirror must be below a certain limit before driving the resonator into the unstable regime.
However, in that situation we effectively have a <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a>, and that has at least one guided mode for an arbitrarily strong contrast of its refractive index profile.</p>
<p>In reality, however, the pump power decays on the way through the crystal.
So we may make a more realistic resonator model, assuming an exponential decay of pump power and heating power along the crystal.
The absorption coefficient may be chosen such that most of the pump light is absorbed in a single pass.
The results are shown in Figure&nbsp;2:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/microchip_resonator.png" alt="mode radius in microchip laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Mode radius a different positions in a microchip laser as a function of the dioptric power of the thermal lens. The calculation has been done with the software <a href="resonator.html"><b>RP Resonator</b></a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the thermal lens becomes rather strong, the mode size begins to vary substantially along the crystal.
For even stronger lensing (from &approx;320&nbsp;/m on), the resonator becomes unstable.
Interestingly, there are further stability regions for even stronger lensing, but these are not of practical relevance.</p>
<p>How strong the thermal lens will actually be, depends of course on the applied pump power and the pump beam radius.
For example, let us assume that we want to make a laser with 1&nbsp;W output power and 5&nbsp;W intracavity power, so that the double-pass <a href="saturation_power.html" title="saturation power: a measure of the incident optical power required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation power</a> should be of the order of 1&nbsp;W.
(This is required in order to operate the laser &approx;5 times above the <a href="laser_threshold.html" title="laser threshold: an operation condition of a laser where laser emission just starts to occur">laser threshold</a>.)
From that one can calculate a beam radius of &approx;150&nbsp;&mu;m.
The dissipated pump power will be roughly 0.35&nbsp;W, and one can calculate that the thermal lens will then have a dioptric power of &approx;4.5&nbsp;/m.
From Figure&nbsp;2 one can see that the mode radius is then &approx;110&nbsp;&mu;m, a bit smaller than the pump beam radius.
So such a laser will probably be single-mode with perfect <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and reasonable efficiency.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Higher Output Powers?</h2>
<div>
<p>How about a 10-W laser of that kind?
Assuming the same degree of output coupling, we should use a 10 times larger pump beam area, i.e., the same pump intensity.
The dioptric power of the thermal lens will then be the same as for the 1-W laser, despite the higher dissipated power.
Therefore, we will also have the same fundamental mode radius.
Now, however, the pump beam radius will now be much larger than that, so that multimode emission with poor <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> is to be expected.</p>
<p>You may try to solve that problem by using a longer laser crystal, but unfortunately that does not help much.
For example, if we take a five times longer crystal (50&nbsp;mm &ndash; maybe no longer practical), also having five times lower doping concentration, the mode radius for thermal lensing with 4.5&nbsp;/m increases only from 110&nbsp;&mu;m to 163&nbsp;&mu;m, while the pump radius should be increased from 150&nbsp;&mu;m to 475&nbsp;&mu;m.
You can also not substantially change the mode radius by changing the absorption coefficient.
Thus, it appears to be impossible to get perfect beam quality.</p>
<p>So you clearly see that the great simplicity of that kind of laser causes a substantial problem: it has very few parameters which we can adjust, and for high-power operation we run into a regime where a high beam quality is no longer feasible!
This is a classical example for a laser architecture which is <em>not</em> <a href="power_scaling_of_lasers.html" title="power scaling of lasers: a procedure for substantially increasing the output power of lasers">power-scalable</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Conclusions</h2>
<div>
<p>You can draw a lot of useful conclusions from these considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The resonator modes of microchip lasers are essentially determined by thermal lensing effects &ndash; much in contrast to those of most other diode-pump lasers.</li>
<li>The basic laser parameters should be calculated based on some essential knowledge of <a href="laser_physics.html" title="laser physics: the field of physics dealing with phenomena in lasers">laser physics</a>.
For example, one can and should calculate an appropriate pump and laser beam radius for the targeted operation parameters.
Also, it is much faster and cheaper to do those calculations than just trying to build such a laser in the lab.
Finding such things with a trial-and-error approach is inefficient and unprofessional.</li>
<li>Such considerations also let you understand certain basic limitations of laser architectures.
In our particular case, we have seen that microchip lasers cannot easily be scaled up to higher powers without losing a good beam quality.
That has to do with the fact that the simplicity of the architecture gives us too few parameters for controlling the mode properties.</li>
</ul>
