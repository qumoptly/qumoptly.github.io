<h2 class="togglediv">Types of Lamps</h2>
<div>
<p>Discharge lamps used for laser pumping are grouped in two categories: arc lamps and flash lamps.
Arc lamps are optimized for <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="continuous-wave operation: operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave operation</a>, whereas flash lamps (flashlamps) produce pump <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a> for either free-running or <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="Q-switched lasers: lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a>.
(Note that the term <em>flash lamp</em> is often wrongly used instead of <em>arc lamp</em>.)
Both types of lamps essentially consist of a glass tube, filled with some gas (e.g. krypton at a few atmospheres) and having a metallic electrode at each end.</p>
<p>Flash lamps are often supplied with electrical energy from a capacitor.
The energy is transmitted through some electronic components (a <em>pulse forming network</em>) which influence the duration of the pump pulse.</p>
<p>For pumping solid-state lasers, one usually uses linear lamps with an electrode separation between 5 and 15&nbsp;cm.
(Short-arc lamps with a much smaller electrode separation of normally less than 1&nbsp;mm, sometimes also with carbon electrodes, are used for other purposes.)
The shape of the lamp's electrodes depends on the mode of operation: flash lamps have rounded cathodes, whereas pointed cathodes are better for arc lamps, which are operated with much lower current densities.
The applied current density can also have a substantial impact on the generated optical spectrum; continuously operated arc lamps often exhibit a pronounced line spectrum, whereas flash lamps have a more smooth spectral shape.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Pump Chamber</h2>

<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a> of a lamp-pumped laser is usually a relatively long <a href="side_pumping.html" title="side pumping: a technique of pumping a solid-state laser in directions which are approximately transverse to its beam direction">side-pumped</a> <a href="rod_lasers.html" title="rod lasers: solid-state lasers with a rod-shaped gain medium">rod</a>, adapted to the length of the lamp.
In many cases, laser rod and lamp are placed within an elliptical <a href="pump_chambers.html" title="pump chambers: a part of a lamp-pumped solid-state laser, containing a laser rod, one or more lamps, reflectors, a cooling arrangement and possibly other parts">pump chamber</a> with reflective walls, so that a larger percentage of the generated pump light can be absorbed in the laser rod.
Excess heat is removed by cooling water, and an additional filter glass may be used to protect the laser rod from <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="ultraviolet light: invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a> emitted by the lamp.</p>
<p>More details are discussed in the article on <a href="pump_chambers.html" title="pump chambers: a part of a lamp-pumped solid-state laser, containing a laser rod, one or more lamps, reflectors, a cooling arrangement and possibly other parts">pump chambers</a>.</p>
<p>Another type of solid-state laser which is suitable for lamp pumping is the face-pumped <a href="slab_lasers.html" title="slab lasers: solid-state bulk lasers where the gain medium has the form of a slab">slab laser</a>.
Here, an array of lamps pumps a slab through its large face, possibly from both sides.
The pump light may be injected through a layer of cooling water.</p>
<p>In any case, the low <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> of lamps restricts the choice of geometry.
For example, <a href="end_pumping.html" title="end pumping: a technique of optically pumping a laser medium in a direction along the laser beam">end pumping</a> requires a higher brightness and is therefore possible only with <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> (or sometimes other kinds of lasers).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Gain Media for Lamp-pumped Lasers</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:250px;">
<img src="img/pump_chamber.jpg" alt="pump chamber">

A pump chamber for Nd:glass rod <a href="amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers: devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifiers</a>.
The photograph has been kindly provided by <a href="bg/profiles/ekspla.html">EKSPLA</a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Concerning the gain medium, the most common type of lamp-pumped laser is the <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="YAG lasers: lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG laser</a>.
Krypton-filled lamps are mostly used in this case, because the krypton emission is strong in the region between 750&nbsp;nm and 900&nbsp;nm, where Nd:YAG has strong absorption lines.
Other <a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="neodymium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium-doped gain media</a> such as Nd:YLF and Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> are also suitable.
These have relatively broad absorption bands and are <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="four-level and three-level gain media: laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">four-level laser media</a>, so that they can be used with moderate pump intensities and utilize a significant part of the lamp <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="optical spectrum: the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">spectrum</a>.
Less common lamp-pumped lasers are based on <a href="alexandrite_lasers.html" title="alexandrite lasers: solid-state lasers based on alexandrite (Cr<sup>3+</sup>:BeAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) crystals">alexandrite</a> (with xenon lamps), <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers: lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">Ti:sapphire</a>, <a href="chromium_doped_gain_media.html" title="chromium-doped gain media: laser gain media doped with chromium ions">Cr:LiSAF</a>, or <a href="dye_lasers.html" title="dye lasers: lasers based on liquid or solid dyes as gain media">laser dyes</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, relatively large <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> are required for lamp-pumped lasers.
This makes it difficult to apply certain crystal types, which are difficult to grow with high quality in large sizes.
<a href="ceramic_gain_media.html" title="ceramic gain media: laser gain media which have a ceramic (polycrystalline) microscopic structure">Ceramic gain media</a>, which can be made very large, are suitable.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Attractions and Limitations of Lamp Pumping</h2>
<div>
<p>The first <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>, the ruby laser built by Maiman [1], was pumped with a flash lamp, and even though <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="diode-pumped lasers: solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped lasers</a> have become very common due to a number of advantages, lamp-pumped lasers will continue to be used for a long time.
Their main advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="ta_left">Very high pump powers (particularly peak powers) can be generated.</li>
<li class="ta_left">The price per watt of generated pump power is much lower for lamps than with laser diodes.</li>
<li class="ta_left">Lamps are fairly robust, e.g. immune to voltage or current spikes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lifetime of lamps is very limited &ndash; normally some hundred or up to a few thousand hours.</li>
<li>The <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="wall-plug efficiency: total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">wall-plug efficiency</a> of the laser is low &ndash; typically at most a few percent.
Consequences of that are not only higher electricity consumption, but also a higher heat load, making necessary a more powerful cooling system, and strong <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="thermal lensing: a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>, making it more difficult to achieve a good <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.</li>
<li>Electric power supplies for lamp-pumped lasers involve high voltages, which raise additional <a href="laser_safety.html" title="laser safety: safety of the use of laser devices">safety issues</a>.</li>
<li>The low pump brightness (compared with that achievable with diode lasers) and the broad emission wavelength range exclude many solid-state gain media.</li>
<li>Lamps are relatively noisy pump sources, leading to higher levels of <a href="laser_noise.html" title="laser noise: fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">laser noise</a>.
For example, Q-switched lamp-pumped lasers often exhibit relatively strong pulse-to-pulse fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, device lifetime, power efficiency, cooling and thermal lensing are not really important issues e.g. when a flash lamp is operated with low pulse repetition rate and low average power, as required e.g. in engraving and <a href="laser_marking.html" title="laser marking: a group of methods for labeling materials with lasers">marking</a> systems.
In such situations, the lamp-specific advantages clearly dominate.
On the other hand, high-power <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="continuous-wave operation: operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> lamp-pumped lasers as well as pulsed lasers operating at high <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="pulse repetition rate: the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rates</a> are more and more replaced with diode-pumped devices such as <a href="thin_disk_lasers.html" title="thin-disk lasers: solid-state bulk lasers having a very thin disk of laser-active material as the gain medium">thin-disk lasers</a> and <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>.</p>
