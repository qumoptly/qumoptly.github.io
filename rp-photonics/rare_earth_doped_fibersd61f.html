<p>The technologically most important rare-earth-doped fibers are erbium-doped fibers for <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a> and ytterbium-doped fibers for <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Importance of the Host Glass</h2>
<div>
<p>The chemical composition of the glass for the laser-active <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> has many important influences on the possible performance and practical use of an active fiber:</p>
<ul>
<li>The limited transparency range may exclude the use of certain laser transitions.
For example, mid-<a href="infrared_light.html" title="infrared light: invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared</a> lasers cannot be realized with silicate fibers, which are strongly absorbing for wavelengths above &asymp;2&nbsp;&mu;m.</li>
<li>The glass composition strongly influences the maximum concentration of the dopant ions that can be incorporated without excessive clustering, which would resulting in <a href="quenching.html" title="quenching: the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> effects and possibly increased propagation losses.</li>
<li>It also influences in various ways the optical transitions of the rare earth ions, in particular the emission and absorption cross sections, absorption and emission bandwidth, total transition rates and thus the metastable <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="upper-state lifetime: the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">level lifetimes</a>, etc.</li>
<li>The rate constants for <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="energy transfer: the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfers</a> between different ions also depend on the chemistry.</li>
<li>Mainly the maximum phonon energy of the host glass determines the rate of <a href="multi_phonon_transitions.html" title="multi-phonon transitions: transitions between electronic levels of atoms or ions in solid media, involving the emission of multiple phonons">multi-phonon transition</a> processes, thus the speed of <a href="non_radiative_transitions.html" title="non-radiative transitions: transitions between energy levels of atoms or ions which are not associated with the emission of light">non-radiative</a> transfers between certain levels.
This effect can be strong: certain levels may be long-lived (multiple milliseconds) in heavy-metal fluoride glasses, but very short-lived (few microseconds) in silicate glasses.</li>
<li>Some glasses (e.g. <a href="fluoride_fibers.html" title="fluoride fibers: optical fibers based on fluoride glasses">fluoride glasses</a>) tend to be difficult and expensive to fabricate and handle.
Clean fiber cleaves are not always easy to obtain, and often require modified methods.</li>
<li>Some glasses are photosensitive, allowing the fabrication of <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a> with <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="ultraviolet light: invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a>.
The photosensitivity can strongly depend on certain dopants.</li>
<li>Glasses differ very much in their optical <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> and optical <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damage threshold</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For rare-earth-doped fibers, the core composition is normally modified by additional dopants.
For example, one rarely uses pure silicate glass, but rather some aluminosilicate, germanosilicate, or phosphosilicate glass.
Some codopants such as aluminum improve the solubility of rare earth ions and thus allow for higher rare-earth <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="doping concentration: the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentrations</a> without <a href="quenching.html" title="quenching: the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> of the <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="upper-state lifetime: the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a>.
Others have effects on the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>, on the spectral shape of the optical transitions, or the rate of energy transfers.
The articles on <a href="rare_earth_doped_gain_media.html" title="rare-earth-doped gain media: laser gain media which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped gain media</a>, <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain media</a>, and <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> give some more details.</p>
<p>For many <a href="upconversion_lasers.html" title="upconversion lasers: lasers relying on upconversion processes">upconversion lasers</a> and <a href="visible_lasers.html" title="visible lasers: lasers (or other laser-based light sources) emitting visible light">visible fiber lasers</a>, some kind of <a href="fluoride_fibers.html" title="fluoride fibers: optical fibers based on fluoride glasses">fluoride glass</a> is required where the phonon energies are lowered so that the <a href="metastable_states.html" title="metastable states: excited states (particularly electronic states in laser gain media) which have a relatively long lifetime due to slow radiative and non-radiative decay">metastable level</a> lifetimes are long enough (no <a href="quenching.html" title="quenching: the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> via <a href="multi_phonon_transitions.html" title="multi-phonon transitions: transitions between electronic levels of atoms or ions in solid media, involving the emission of multiple phonons">multi-phonon transitions</a>).
Such fluoride fibers also exhibit good transmission in the mid-infrared and are therefore used for <a href="mid_infrared_laser_sources.html" title="mid-infrared laser sources: light sources emitting mid-infrared radiation in the form of a laser-like beam">mid-infrared laser sources</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Codoped Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>Some fibers are intentionally doped with two different kinds of rare earth ions.
Most popular is the combination of erbium and ytterbium (<em>erbium&ndash;ytterbium fibers</em>) &ndash; normally with a significantly higher concentration of ytterbium.
When such a fiber is <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="optical pumping: electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">pumped</a> e.g. around 980&nbsp;nm, most of the pump light is absorbed by ytterbium ions (called <em>sensitizer ions</em>), bringing these into their excited states.
From there, the energy can be efficiently <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="energy transfer: the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">transferred</a> to the erbium ions, which then provide laser gain in the 1.5-&mu;m spectral region.
Compared with purely erbium-doped fibers, Er:Yb fibers offer much higher <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="pump absorption: the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> per unit length and can therefore be used for fiber devices with much shorter lengths, such as <a href="distributed_feedback_lasers.html" title="distributed feedback lasers: lasers where the whole laser resonator consists of a periodic structure, in which Bragg reflection occurs">distributed-feedback lasers</a>.
For example, this is useful for making robust <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="single-frequency lasers: lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency fiber lasers</a> of a few centimeters length, or for <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fiber</a> devices with a moderate length.</p>
<p>For the energy transfer to be efficient, the doping concentrations have to be well balanced, and the core composition must be suitable.</p>
<p>Ytterbium codoping can also be used for other gain systems, such as in praseodymium-doped <a href="upconversion_lasers.html" title="upconversion lasers: lasers relying on upconversion processes">upconversion lasers</a>.
This allows for, e.g., red, orange or blue emission with single-wavelength pumping (instead of dual-wavelength pumping for purely praseodymium-doped fibers).</p>
<p>Codopants can also be used for quenching the lower-state population in gain systems with <a href="self_terminating_laser_transitions.html" title="self-terminating laser transitions: laser transitions which can not be continuously operated due to the accumulation of population in the lower laser level">self-terminating laser transitions</a>.
For example, praseodymium codoping allows for relatively efficient operation of 2.7-&mu;m erbium fiber lasers.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fibers for High-power Lasers and Amplifiers</h2>
<div>
<p>For <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers</a>, <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light"><em>double-clad fibers</em></a> are used.
These have a highly multimode inner cladding, into which the pump light is launched, and a <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> which is either <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a> or supports only a few <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>.
Only the core (or sometimes a ring around the core) is rare earth doped.
Such fibers allow for a high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> of the laser or amplifier output, whereas the pump beam quality can be very low.
The resulting devices are often called <a href="brightness_converters.html" title="brightness converters: optically pumped devices where the generated optical output has a higher brightness than the optical pump source"><em>brightness converters</em></a>, since the <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> of the output can be much higher than that of the pump source.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Characterization of Rare-earth-doped Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>In addition to all the properties of a passive (undoped) optical <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>, such as the guiding properties (<a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a>, <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>, <a href="cut_off_wavelength.html" title="cut-off wavelength: a wavelength above which a guided mode of a waveguide ceases to exist">cut-off wavelength</a>, <a href="bend_losses.html" title="bend losses: propagation losses in an optical fiber (or other waveguide) caused by bending">bend losses</a>), <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>, etc., active fibers can be characterized with respect to several other properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most important parameters is the rare-earth <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="doping concentration: the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium"><em>doping concentration</em></a>, most often specified in ppm wt (parts per million by weight).
A higher doping concentration allows for efficient pump absorption in a shorter length and thus also reduces the effect of <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> in high <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> devices.
However, it can also lead to concentration <a href="quenching.html" title="quenching: the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a>.</li>
<li>Wavelength-dependent <a href="effective_transition_cross_sections.html" title="effective transition cross sections: a modified type of transition cross sections which apply to optical transitions between Stark level manifolds"><em>effective absorption and emission cross sections</em></a> (and possibly <a href="excited_state_absorption.html" title="excited-state absorption: absorption of light by ions or atoms in an excited electronic state, rather than in the electronic ground state">ESA</a> cross sections) together with the <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="upper-state lifetime: the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a> (and possibly lifetimes of intermediate levels) are required for calculating the <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tuning</a> behavior, power efficiency, etc.</li>
<li>Parameters for quantifying the speed of <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="energy transfer: the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfer</a> processes are important particularly for codoped fibers.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an alternative method, so-called <a href="giles_parameters.html" title="Giles parameters: spectroscopic data concerning absorption and amplification in an active fiber"><em>Giles parameters</em></a> can be specified, which depend on the doping concentration, <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a> and <a href="effective_transition_cross_sections.html" title="effective transition cross sections: a modified type of transition cross sections which apply to optical transitions between Stark level manifolds">effective transition cross sections</a>.</p>
<p>For such characterization, a variety of measurement techniques are used.
White-light absorption spectra can be used for finding absorption cross sections (for known doping concentrations).
Emission cross sections are obtained from <a href="fluorescence.html" title="fluorescence: luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> spectra, with scaling e.g. via the <a href="reciprocity_method.html" title="reciprocity method: a spectroscopic method which is often used for obtaining the scaling of emission spectra of laser gain media"><em>reciprocity method</em></a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="mccumber_theory.html" title="McCumber theory: a theory applied to absorption and emission properties of laser gain media, in particular to solid-state media"><em>McCumber theory</em></a>) or the metastable level lifetimes (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="fuchtbauer_ladenburg_equation.html" title="Füchtbauer&ndash;Ladenburg equation: an equation used for calculating emission cross sections of laser gain media"><em>Füchtbauer&ndash;Ladenburg equation</em></a>).
<a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="upper-state lifetime: the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">Upper-state lifetimes</a> are often obtained from fluorescence measurements with pulsed pumping, and <a href="excited_state_absorption.html" title="excited-state absorption: absorption of light by ions or atoms in an excited electronic state, rather than in the electronic ground state">ESA</a> parameters can be obtained in experiments with a modulated pump power.</p>
<p>The resulting set of data can be used e.g. in <a href="laser_modeling.html" title="laser modeling: the investigation of phenomena and quantitative relations in lasers, using theoretical models and computational methods">laser and amplifier models</a> based on <a href="rate_equation_modeling.html" title="rate equation modeling: a method of modeling the dynamics of laser gain media">rate equations</a>.
Such models allow one, e.g., to predict or check the performance of fiber laser or amplifier devices, the effect of possible modifications, etc.</p>
<p>Further characterization may be required for quantifying effects such as <a href="photodarkening.html" title="photodarkening: the phenomenon that the optical power losses in a medium can grow when the medium is irradiated with light at certain wavelengths">photodarkening</a>, which can sometimes seriously degrade the efficiency of active fiber devices.</p>

<h2>Shortages of rare earth materials &ndash; a problem for photonics?</h2>
<p>Photonics heavily depends on the supply of rare earth materials in various areas &ndash; think of <a href="laser_crystalsd61f.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">laser crystals</a>, <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibersd61f.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">active fibers</a> and <a href="light_emitting_diodesd61f.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">LEDs</a>, for example.
It is hard to see how such things could be done without rare earth materials.
And those have recently been subject to enormous price increases and were even involved in a trade war.</p>
<p>Is that now a reason for serious concerns in the area of photonics?
Do we need to undertake serious recycling efforts?
Our <a href="spotlight_2014_06_27d61f.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">Photonics Spotlight article</a> analyzes the situation.</p>
<p>Receiving the <a href="spotlightd61f.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">Photonics Spotlight</a> via our <a href="newslettersd61f.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">newsletter</a> might be a good idea &hellip;</p>
