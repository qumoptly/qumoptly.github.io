<p>A simple way to realize a reflecting device (a <a href="mirrors.html" title="mirrors: devices which reflect light">mirror</a>) in <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="fiber optics: optics based on optical fibers">fiber optics</a> is to make a <em>fiber loop</em>, using a two-by-two directional <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber couplers: fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber coupler</a> where the ports on one side are connected to each other with a piece of fiber (see Figure&nbsp;1).</p>
<figure class="left" style="width:159px;">
<img src="img/fiber_loop.png" alt="fiber loop">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A simple fiber loop mirror.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If one feeds light into one input port (e.g., the upper one in Figure&nbsp;1), the power is split so that two counterpropagating waves are formed in the loop.
When these waves then again come together at the coupler, they interfere with each other.
This <a href="interference.html" title="interference: a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> determines the <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> sent back into the input port as well as the power leaving the other port.
The interference conditions can in general be influenced by various aspects that as <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode</a> behavior, polarization changes and <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear effects</a>.</p>
<p>The fiber loop mirror can also be considered as a <em>Sagnac interferometer</em>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Linear Fiber Loop Mirrors</h2>
<div>
<p>In the simplest case, one uses only <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a>, and the <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">polarization state</a> remains unchanged during propagation.
(One may use <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="polarization-maintaining fibers: specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining fiber</a> or alternatively a <a href="fiber_polarization_controllers.html" title="fiber polarization controllers: devices which allow one to control the state of polarization of light within fibers">fiber polarization controller</a> to obtain that situation even when using a long loop.)
Also, we assume that the optical powers are so low that <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear effects</a> (particularly the <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="Kerr effect: a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr effect</a>) are negligibly weak.
Further, we assume that no power losses occur in the fibers, and that the <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber couplers: fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber coupler</a> has 50:50 power splitting ratio (i.e., it is a 3-dB coupler).
In this simple case, the interference conditions are such that all injected power goes back to the port into which it was injected.
This means that the fiber loop mirror acts as a perfect reflector, working in a wide range of wavelengths, and for any input polarization state.
The length of the fiber loop is not relevant in this case.
Similarly, environmental effects on the fiber in the loop such as temperature changes have no effect as long as they cannot affect the polarization.</p>
<p>If the power splitting ratio deviates from 50:50, one obtains less than 100&#37; reflectivity.
This is shown in Figure&nbsp;2.
Again, the results are not dependent on the loop length.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiber_loop1.png" alt="reflectivity of fiber loop">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Power reflectivity of a linear fiber loop mirror as a function of the coupling ratio of the used fiber coupler.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As the coupling ratio of a fiber coupler usually exhibits a substantial wavelength dependence, this transforms into an overall wavelength-dependent reflectivity of the fiber loop mirror.</p>
<p>A strong wavelength dependence can also be associated with <a href="birefringence.html" title="birefringence: the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a>.
If a highly birefringent fiber (e.g. a <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="polarization-maintaining fibers: specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining fiber</a>) is incorporated into the fiber loop, and the polarization evolution is properly adjusted with a <a href="fiber_polarization_controllers.html" title="fiber polarization controllers: devices which allow one to control the state of polarization of light within fibers">fiber polarization controller</a>, the spectral transmission function can exhibit pronounced oscillations.
Their spectral period is inversely proportional to the birefringence (the index contrast between the polarization directions) and the length of that fiber.
As the positions of the relatively sharply defined transmission dips react to temperature and strain, the configuration can be used as a <a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="fiber-optic sensors: optical sensors based on fiber devices">fiber-optic sensor</a>.
An attraction is that whereas one measures changes of birefringence with interferometric accuracy, one is not particularly sensitive to environmental influences on the ordinary fiber connecting the birefringent fiber.
One may also realize nearly temperature-independent strain sensors by using highly birefringent <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="photonic crystal fibers: specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a>, exhibiting a low temperature dependence of the birefringence, at least when the polymer coating is removed.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Nonlinear Fiber Loop Mirrors</h2>
<div>
<p>Particularly for <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> in fibers, the <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="Kerr effect: a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr nonlinearity</a> can have substantial effects, as the <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> can be high.
However, as long as the fiber loop remains symmetric and the coupling ratio is 50:50, the occurring nonlinear <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> shifts do <em>not</em> influence the fiber loop's reflectivity.
This is because these phase shifts are the same for light propagating in both directions, so that these additional phase shifts cannot affect the interference conditions.</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:328px;">
<img src="img/nonlinear_fiber_loop_mirror.png" alt="nonlinear amplifying loop mirror">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
A nonlinear amplifying loop mirror, containing an active fiber and a longer passive fiber.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This changes for an asymmetric design.
For example, a fiber loop may contain a <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fiber</a>, which can amplify light when suitable pump light is injected, and a long passive fiber (see Figure&nbsp;3).
This configuration is called a <em>nonlinear amplifying loop mirror</em> (NALM).
When light injected on the left side at a low power level, it will be mostly reflected back into the same port.
In case of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> with a substantial <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a>, however, we have substantial nonlinear phase changes in the loop.
These are stronger for light propagating in counter-clockwise direction, since this is first amplified and then travels through the long passive fiber.
Light in the opposite direction propagates with a lower power level for most of the length.
As a result, the interference conditions are affected such that a power-dependent fraction of the input light reaches the upper output port.</p>
<p>Such a power dependence would also result from strong optical attenuation on one side of a long passive fiber only, or simply from having an asymmetric coupling ratio.
In that case, one has a <em>nonlinear loop mirror</em> (NOLM).</p>
<p>The operation details are complicated by the fact that the nonlinear phase shift is not constant over the temporal pulse profile, but rather strongest for the peak and weaker in the wings.
Furthermore, <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> can have substantial effects.
Therefore, the overall behavior can be understood well only by using a numerical simulation model.
Figure&nbsp;4 shows the outputs in an example case, where the loop contains a 1&nbsp;m long ytterbium-doped fiber and a 10&nbsp;m long passive fiber.
For <a href="solitons.html" title="solitons: pulses with a certain balance of nonlinear and dispersive effects">soliton</a>-shaped input pulses with 0.1&nbsp;nJ energy and 2&nbsp;ps duration, a substantial part of the output power goes into the upper output port.
The amplifier is pumped with 100&nbsp;mW at 975&nbsp;nm, and the steady state for a pulse train with 10&nbsp;MHz repetition rate has been calculated.
Both fibers exhibit normal dispersion; in the anomalous dispersion regime, where <a href="solitons.html" title="solitons: pulses with a certain balance of nonlinear and dispersive effects">soliton</a> effects can occur, the characteristics of the nonlinear loop mirror are significantly different.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/nonlinear_fiber_loop_mirror2.png" alt="outputs of fiber loop mirror in the time-domain">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span> 
Output powers of the two ports of an amplifying fiber loop mirror in the time domain. The numerical simulation has been done with the software <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the pulse peak, the difference in nonlinear phase shifts between the two propagation directions in the loop is larger than <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&pi;</span></span>, which would be the ideal value for coupling to the upper output port.
However, this improves the coupling in the wings.
Overall, this situation is close to the case with optimum coupling.</p>
<p>Generally, substantial pulse distortions must be expected, even though their type and magnitude can strongly depend on details like chromatic dispersion and operation power levels.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;5 shows how the ratio of output energy in the upper port to input energy in the lower port varies with the input pulse energy.
This dependence is influenced by various effects: increasing <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="gain saturation: the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">gain saturation</a> in the amplifying fiber and increasing pulse distortions through chromatic dispersion and fiber nonlinearity for increasing pulse energies.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;5:</span> 
Fraction of output power in the upper output port as a function of the input pulse energy.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are various applications of nonlinear fiber loop mirrors:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a <a href="mode_locked_fiber_lasers.html" title="mode-locked fiber lasers: ultrafast fiber lasers which are actively or passively mode-locked for generating ultrashort pulses">mode-locked fiber laser</a>, such a device can act as an artificial <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="saturable absorbers: light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorber</a> which starts and stabilizes the <a href="mode_locking.html" title="mode locking: a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode locking</a>, i.e., the pulse formation [6].
A well-known embodiment of this approach is the <em>figure-of-eight fiber laser</em>, where the nonlinear fiber loop mirror forms one part of the &ldquo;eight&rdquo; and the actual <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> the other one.
The article on <a href="mode_locked_fiber_lasers.html" title="mode-locked fiber lasers: ultrafast fiber lasers which are actively or passively mode-locked for generating ultrashort pulses">mode-locked fiber lasers</a> contains more details on this.</li>
<li>In <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, nonlinear loop mirrors can be used as nonlinear filters.
For example, a well designed filter may well transmit <a href="solitons.html" title="solitons: pulses with a certain balance of nonlinear and dispersive effects">soliton</a> pulses (without substantial distortions) while largely suppressing any low-intensity background radiation; it can then be called a <em>soliton filter</em>.
The same can also be useful in other application areas where optical signal processing is required.</li>

<h2>Photonics in Times of Trouble for International Trade</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px;">This <a href="spotlight_2017_02_17c8d6.html?banner=International_trade">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> addresses the current serious concerns about the future of international trade and more generally international cooperation. Some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>German trade surplus</b> deserves attention, but claiming unfair practices without differentiating between different sectors of the economy is just stupid talk.</li>
<li>Already announced changes of US policy constitute a serious threat of beginning <b>trade wars</b>, which could have disastrous consequences.</li>
<li>There are also <b>ruthless attacks on essential values</b>, contributing to a breakdown of cooperation.</li>
<li>If we do not stop these developments in time, we may get into the <b>big crunch</b>.</li>
<li>We must <b>fiercely defend fundamental values</b> as well as <b>international cooperation</b>, because this is the only chance to solve a wide range of serious problems.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:14px;">You are welcome to <a href="spotlight_2017_02_17c8d6.html?banner=International_trade">read the article</a>. Note that you can get the <a href="spotlightc8d6.html?banner=International_trade">Photonics Spotlight</a> as an e-mail newsletter.</p>
