<p>Fiber optics is the technology based on optical <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>, i.e., on mostly flexible <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a> for light.
The article on <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> describes the core technology, including various types of glass fibers (e.g. <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a> and <a href="fluoride_fibers.html" title="fluoride fibers: optical fibers based on fluoride glasses">fluoride fibers</a>) but also <a href="plastic_optical_fibers.html" title="plastic optical fibers: optical fibers made of polymer materials">plastic optical fibers</a>.
Apart from the basic materials, fibers can differ in many other respects, particularly concerning the propagation characteristics of light in their <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber cores</a>.

Light can be launched into a fiber, where it can propagate with a constant beam radius until it leaves the fiber.
One can also combine multiple fiber-optic elements.
In all-fiber setups, the light may entirely stay within fiber waveguides.

</figure>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Cables</h2>
<div>
<p>Fibers are often used in the form of <a href="fiber_cables.html" title="fiber cables: cables containing one or several optical fibers">optical fiber cables</a>, where the actual fiber is embedded into a supporting structure, which protects it mostly against mechanical stress and moisture.
Fiber cables are often terminated with <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="fiber connectors: connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connectors</a>, so that they can be plugged in a similar way as electrical cables, although fiber-optic connections are tentatively more delicate.</p>
<p>Fiber cables can differ in many respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can contain different types of fibers, for example <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a> or <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode</a> glass fibers or <a href="plastic_optical_fibers.html" title="plastic optical fibers: optical fibers made of polymer materials">plastic fibers</a> with different specifications.</li>
<li>Cables can contain different numbers of fibers &ndash; between 1 and several hundred.</li>
<li>They can have different levels of protection of the fibers, e.g. against mechanical damage and moisture.</li>
<li>In addition, some fiber cables are fire-retardant.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details can be found in the article on <a href="fiber_cables.html" title="fiber cables: cables containing one or several optical fibers">fiber cables</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber-optic Components</h2>
<div>
<p>Apart from the fibers, there are various types of fiber-optic elements, which may be connected with each other using optical fibers.
Some of these are essentially made of fibers, whereas others consist of utterly different materials but are coupled to fibers, i.e., they offer fibers for input and output purposes.
Some examples for fiber-optical components:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">Fiber-coupled laser diodes</a> can be used as light sources for fiber optics.
One may also use <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> or other lasers in combination with a fiber launch setup.</li>
<li><a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber couplers: fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">Fiber couplers</a> can be used e.g. for combining light from different sources into one fiber, or as fiber splitters e.g. for distributing television (cable-TV) signals to different users.</li>
<li>Fiber-optic <a href="mode_size_converters.html" title="mode size converters: optical devices which allow for efficient coupling between modes of different sizes">mode size converters</a> can efficiently couple light between fibers with different <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode areas</a>.</li>
<li><a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">Fiber Bragg gratings</a> can be used as strongly wavelength-selective fiber-optic reflectors, e.g. for add-drop multiplexers in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">telecom applications</a> with <a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="wavelength division multiplexing: a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain">wavelength division multiplexing</a>.
Another application is the introduction of tailored wavelength-dependent losses, e.g. for <a href="gain_equalization.html" title="gain equalization: a technique for making the gain spectrum of an optical amplifier device flatter over a certain optical frequency range">gain flattening</a> of fiber amplifier systems.</li>
<li><a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="fiber connectors: connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">Fiber connectors</a> allow one to have removable and reconfigurable connections between fiber devices &ndash; similar to electrical connections, although often more sensitive.</li>
<li><a href="fiber_collimators.html" title="fiber collimators: devices for collimating the light coming from a fiber, or for launching collimated light into the fiber">Fiber collimators</a> provide a connection between fiber optics and free-space optics: they can collimate the output from a fiber, or launch a collimated beam into a fiber.</li>
<li>Fiber-coupled <a href="faraday_isolators.html" title="Faraday isolators: optical isolators based on the Faraday effect">Faraday isolators</a>, <a href="faraday_rotators.html" title="Faraday rotators: devices which can rotate the polarization state of light, exploiting the Faraday effect">rotators</a> and circulators can be used for manipulations based on beam polarization.</li>
<li>There are various others fiber-coupled components for beam manipulation, such as fiber-optic <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="optical modulators: devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">modulators</a> and <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="saturable absorbers: light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorbers</a>.</li>
<li>There are fiber-coupled <a href="powermeters.html" title="powermeters: devices for optical power measurements, based e.g. on heating of an absorber structure">powermeters</a> and <a href="spectrometers.html" title="spectrometers: devices for separating spectral components">spectrometers</a> for monitoring <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> and <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="optical spectrum: the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectra</a>.
Other devices can monitor the <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">polarization</a> state.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber-optic Setups</h2>
<div>
<p>One may combine multiple fiber-optical elements to obtain all-fiber setups with complex functionality.
For example, one can assemble <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="diode-pumped lasers: solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped</a> (<a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>, see below) from <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled laser diodes</a>, <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a> and <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber couplers: fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a>.
Additional elements such as fiber-coupled <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="saturable absorbers: light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorbers</a> and fibers for <a href="dispersion_compensation.html" title="dispersion compensation: the control of the overall chromatic dispersion of a system by adding optical elements with a suitable amount of dispersion">dispersion compensation</a> allow one to obtain <a href="mode_locking.html" title="mode locking: a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode-locked operation</a>, where the laser emits a train of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>.
One can also use elements for <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a>, <a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="stabilization of lasers: measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities">power stabilization</a>, <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tuning</a> and various other purposes.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Amplifiers and Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>In laser-active fibers, which are in most cases <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped fibers</a>, one can perform laser amplification processes based on <a href="stimulated_emission.html" title="stimulated emission: a quantum effect, where photon emission is triggered by other photons">stimulated emission</a>.
The laser-active ions, e.g. Yb<sup>3+</sup>, Er<sup>3+</sup> or Tm<sup>3+</sup>, are pumped with some typically shorter-wavelength pump light injected into the fiber, and can then amplify some signal light.
<a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">Fiber amplifiers</a> based on that technology can easily provide a power <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> of several tens of <a href="decibel.html" title="decibel: a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a>.
<a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">High-power</a> versions based on <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a> can generate average output powers of hundreds or even thousands of watts.
By incorporation of reflectors such as <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a>, or by building ring resonators, one can also realize <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>.</p>

<p>Due to high laser <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, effects of <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="amplified spontaneous emission: a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a>, the <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="four-level and three-level gain media: laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level behavior</a> of typical laser-active ions in fibers, strong <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="gain saturation: the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">gain saturation</a> effects etc., the operation details of fiber amplifiers and lasers are often more complicated than those of bulk lasers.
Therefore, detailed <a href="laser_modeling.html" title="laser modeling: the investigation of phenomena and quantitative relations in lasers, using theoretical models and computational methods">laser modeling</a> is particularly important in this area in order to obtain a clear understanding, based on which device designs can be optimized.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Comparison of Bulk Optics and Fiber Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>Traditional bulk-optical setups comprise discrete optical elements such as <a href="mirrors.html" title="mirrors: devices which reflect light">mirrors</a>, <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lenses</a>, <a href="polarizers.html" title="polarizers: optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizers</a>, <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">filters</a>, etc., whereas fiber optics may be use to make all-fiber setups.</p>
<p>The different technological approaches can differ in many respects:</p>
<aside class="callout blue">The robustness of fiber-optic setups is an important advantage &ndash; but only for all-fiber technology.</aside>
<ul>
<li>An important practical advantage of all-fiber setups is their robustness.
All components are connected with each other, so that they cannot become misaligned after fabrication.
Often, but not always, the contained fibers can be bent or twisted during operation without any detrimental effects.
Different parts of a setup can be mounted on parts which are not rigidly connected with each other.
As the light is entirely kept within fiber cores and closed optical components, there is no risk that dirt and dust particles can effect it.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout blue">The higher flexibility of bulk optics is convenient in development, testing and maintenance.</aside>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, a bulk-optical setup is often more convenient during development, testing and maintenance, as one can more easily remove or replace optical components and access beams e.g. in order to measure their optical powers or beam profiles.
One can thus more easily identify and cure the reason of faults or optimize single components.
Also, one may easily change e.g. the beam sizes within a whole bulk laser setup by exchanging a single mirror or changing its position, whereas such an operation in a fiber-optic setup would require one to replace all or most components.</li>
<li>Bulk-optical elements are often easier to procure.
A problem with fiber-optic elements is that various additional parameters such as <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">mode sizes</a>, <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="polarization-maintaining fibers: specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining</a> guidance or not, type and thickness of protective coating, etc. make it more difficult for suppliers to fabricate all combinations of interest and keep these on stock.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="callout blue">Fiber-optical technology can result in significant savings on opto-mechanical parts.</aside>
<ul>
<li>Bulk-optical setups often need to contain a lot of expensive positioning equipment (opto-mechanics), and each fabricated device must undergo an alignment procedure which is not always easy to automate.
Fiber-optical setups also need fine alignments, but usually only during fabrication, so that there can be large savings on opto-mechanical parts.
On the other hand, the required lab equipment for working with fiber optics comprises expensive things such as <a href="fusion_splicing_of_fibers.html" title="fusion splicing of fibers: a technique of making low-loss fiber joints by fusing fiber ends together">fusion splicers</a>.
Therefore, cost savings with fiber optics are more likely for large quantities, but not for small quantities, as they often occur in optical technology.</li>
<li>The article on <a href="fiber_lasers_versus_bulk_lasers.html">fiber lasers versus bulk lasers</a> discusses various specific aspects in the context of <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> &ndash; among others, influences on the technology on the possible performance of laser devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, bulk and fiber technologies are also used in mixed forms, where the light partly travels through air and bulk-optical elements and partly through fibers.
One may then obtain advantages of both technologies, but also disadvantages of both.
For example, the robustness of a fiber-optical solution may be lost entirely if a setup contains only a single free-space beam path.
(Note that re-launching light into a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a> requires a more sensitive alignment than that in many bulk-optical setups.)</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Important Applications of Fiber Optics</h2>
<div>
<p>Fiber optics have become a very important area of photonics technology.
In the following, we briefly discuss some particularly important areas of application:</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Optical fiber communications is perhaps the most prominent example for the enormous importance of fiber optics.</aside>
<ul>
<li><a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">Optical fiber communications</a> have become a core technology, allowing the extremely fast and low-cost transmission of mostly digital data for telephony, video and television (cable-TV) signals, computing, etc.
The development of the Internet profits enormously from modern fiber optics.
This holds not only for passive <a href="telecom_fibers.html" title="telecom fibers: optical fibers for use in optical fiber communications">telecom fibers</a>, which are used for the actual data transmission, but also for additional technology such as <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> for compensating fiber losses, <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber couplers: fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a> for combining or splitting of signals, <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a> for filtering purposes, <a href="specialty_fibers.html" title="specialty fibers: optical fibers with special designs or materials">specialty fibers</a> for nonlinear data processing and various others fiber-optic devices.
Glass fibers now totally dominate long-haul data transmission, and even for short-distance transmission in buildings or even within apparatuses fiber optics gains more and more ground.</li>
<li>Various types of <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a> have become important light sources not only for low-power applications, but even for <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">very high output powers</a> in the domain of multiple kilowatts of average power and megawatts to gigawatts of <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> (at least in conjunction with bulk-optical <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="pulse compression: linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">pulse compressors</a>).
They compete with various types of bulk lasers, and depending on many circumstances, one of these technologies may be more appropriate.
For more details, see the article on <a href="fiber_lasers_versus_bulk_lasers.html">fiber lasers versus bulk lasers</a>.</li>
<li><a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="fiber-optic sensors: optical sensors based on fiber devices">Fiber-optic sensors</a> for quantities like temperature, stress and strain, rotation, chemical compositions etc. have pervaded various fields, including aircraft &amp; space technology, oil exploration, and the monitoring of buildings (e.g. large bridges) and pipelines.
Both localized and distributed fiber-optic sensors, based on a wide range of physical principles, are nowadays applied in many fields.</li>
<li>Many fibers simply transport light from a source to an application &ndash; for example, from a high-power <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diode</a> setup to a <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk laser</a>, from a laser diode to a light-powered sensor system on a high-voltage transmission line (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="power_over_fiber.html" title="power over fiber: delivery of power for electronic devices via light in an optical fiber"><em>power over fiber</em></a>), or from a high-power <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber laser</a> to a welding robot in a car factory.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Modeling of Fiber Devices</h2>
<div>
<p>Physical modeling is often crucial for analyzing and optimizing the operation details of fiber-optic devices.
Many different aspects can be the subject of such modeling:</p>
<ul>
<li>The properties of the fiber <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a> depend in non-trivial ways on the fiber designs.
Optimized mode structures are often crucial for the performance of fibers.</li>
<li>Although many aspects of light propagation in fibers can be described on the basis of <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>, numerical beam propagation is often required, e.g. for studying effects of imperfections, bending and other external influences.
Also, a mode-based analysis may not be practical in situations with a very large number of modes.</li>
<li>The behavior of rare-earth ions in active fiber devices (<a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">amplifiers</a> and <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">lasers</a>) is essential for the power conversion in such devices.
As extreme conditions in terms of optical intensities and gains often occur in <a href="fiber_optics.html" title="fiber optics: optics based on optical fibers">fiber-optic</a> devices, such modeling is tentatively more sophisticated than in <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>.</li>
<li>The propagation of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> in fibers introduces additional aspects such as influences of <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> and <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>.
Note that such effects are particularly strong in fibers due to the typically long device length and small <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For many such aspects, <a href="fiber_simulation_software.html" title="fiber simulation software: software for numerical simulations on fiber devices">fiber simulation software</a> is used &ndash; particularly for various kinds of numerical simulations.</p>
