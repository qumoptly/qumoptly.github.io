<p>In most cases, a laser emits <a href="laser_light.html" title="laser light: light generated with a laser device">light</a> in the form of a laser beam.
This means that the light dominantly propagates in a certain direction, typically with most of the <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> concentrated to a small area of the order of a square millimeter.</p>
<p>Laser beams are often close to <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="Gaussian beams: light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beams</a>, where the transverse profile of the <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical intensity: optical power per unit area">optical intensity</a> of the beam can be described with a Gaussian function, the width of which varies along the propagation direction.
This variation of beam size can be very small for beams with large width or very fast for tightly focused beams.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/gaussian_beam.png" alt="Gaussian beam">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Snapshot of the electric field distribution around the focus of a <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="Gaussian beams: light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a>. In this example, the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="beam radius: a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> is only slightly larger than the wavelength, and the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> is strong.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Generally, laser beams exhibit a high degree of spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="coherence: a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>, which is related to a high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
As a result, such beams exhibit good focusability and the potential to form <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="collimated beams: laser beams with weak divergence">collimated beams</a> with very low <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>.</p>
<p>The propagation of <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="Gaussian beams: light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beams</a> can be calculated with a set of relatively simple equations.
For beams with non-ideal <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, one can use a generalized set of equations which also involves the so-called beam quality factor <a href="m2_factor.html" title="<i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor: a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup></a>.
In this case, the questions cannot predict the detailed evolution of beam profile, but only of the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="beam radius: a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> based on the second moment of the intensity profile (D4&sigma; method).</p>
<p>Laser beams often have a small optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>, so that the temporal <a href="coherence.html" title="coherence: a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> is also high.
An often unwanted consequence of the high level of coherence is the tendency to form <a href="speckle.html" title="speckle: light patterns resulting from the reflection of coherent light at rough surfaces">speckle</a> patterns.</p>
<p>The <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> of a laser beam may hardly change during propagation in a transparent medium, or quickly decay in an absorbing or scattering medium.
Inhomogeneous media (i.e., media with a locally varying <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a>) can also distort the shapes of laser beams.
This can happen due to e.g. thermal effects such as <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="thermal lensing: a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a> in a <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>.</p>
<p>Some lasers emit <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="continuous-wave operation: operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuously</a>, but a laser beam can also consist of a fast sequence of <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a>, with many millions or even billions of pulses per second (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="pulse repetition rate: the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser"><em>pulse repetition rate</em></a>).</p>
<p>Most laser beams are <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">linearly polarized</a>, i.e., the electric field oscillates in a certain direction perpendicular to the propagation direction.
Some lasers, however, emit light with an undefined, fluctuating polarization state.</p>
<p>A laser beam of visible light with sufficiently high power may be visible when propagating in air.
This is because a tiny portion of the optical power is scattered by dust particles and/or density fluctuations in the air and can therefore reach the observing eye.
When the laser beam hits some diffusely scattering object, such as a white screen, a much brighter spot is seen on that screen, since most of the optical power is scattered at this point.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Near Field and Far Field of Laser Beams</h2>
<div>
<p>The <em>near field</em> of a laser beam is understood to be the region around the <a href="beam_waist.html" title="beam waist: location with minimum beam radius">beam waist</a> (focus).
The <em>far field</em> concerns the beam profile far from the beam waist, i.e., in a distance from the focus which is large compared with the effective <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="Rayleigh length: the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a>.
The far field intensity profile reveals details of the <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>, which in the near field can be obtained only with wavefront measurements.
As it is often not practical to access the far field directly, one may use a focusing <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a> (or mirror) to obtain an intensity profile in its focal plane which reveals a scaled-down version of the far field pattern.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Limitations for the Focusing of Laser Beams</h2>
<div>
<p>Laser beams can be used for transmitting optical energy to rather small spots or with low <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> over large distances.
However, there are limitations to this, which involve the optical <a href="wavelength.html" title="wavelength: the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a>, the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and the transverse size of the used focusing or <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="collimated beams: laser beams with weak divergence">collimation</a> optics.
Some of these limitations are discussed in the following, always assuming propagation of the beam through a homogeneous medium (i.e., with no added beam distortions on the way).</p>
<p>If a laser beam is focused to a spot (<a href="beam_waist.html" title="beam waist: location with minimum beam radius">beam waist</a>) with <a href="beam_radius.html" title="beam radius: a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>w</i><sub>0</sub></span>, it exhibits a certain <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> angle which is inversely proportional to the waist beam radius and proportional to the optical wavelength in the <a href="m2_factor.html" title="<i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor: a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a>:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/theta_m2.gif" width="85" height="45" alt="beam divergence for non-ideal laser beam"></div>
<p>The used focusing optics must be able to handle that amount of beam divergence; a limitation for that results from the limited <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> of the optics.
Also, if the focus has to have a large distance from the focusing optics and/or the waist beam radius is small or the beam quality is low, the beam radius in the focusing optics will necessarily be quite large.
A correspondingly large open aperture of the optics is required.
Such factors can in practice set a lower limit to the achievable beam radius in the focus, or an upper limit to the tolerable <a href="m2_factor.html" title="<i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor: a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a> of the beam.</p>
<p>In some cases, one optimizes the beam radius in the beam focus such that the beam radius at a certain distance from the focus is as small as possible.
For that purpose, one has to choose the waist beam radius such that the effective <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="Rayleigh length: the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a> of the beam equals the mentioned transmission distance.
The resulting beam radius at the distant position will then be &asymp;1.41 times the waist beam radius.</p>
<p>If the sent-out beam does not have to have its focus at the focusing optics, one should place the focus in the middle between the optics and the distant point.
Ideally, the effective Rayleigh length will then be half the transmission distance.
The beam radius at the distance spot will be identical to that at the focusing optics, and &asymp;1.41 times larger than in the beam focus.</p>
<p>For example, if a Gaussian laser beam at 1064&nbsp;nm should be sent to the moon (distance 380&thinsp;000&nbsp;km) in order to illuminate a small spot there, the ideal beam radius in the focus will be 8&nbsp;m, such that the Rayleigh length is 190&thinsp;000&nbsp;km.
The beam radius in the focusing optics and on the moon will then be 11.3&nbsp;m.
If the used sending telescope cannot be that large, the illuminated spot on the moon will be larger.</p>
<p>When creating a beam focus in some distance from some focusing optics with a limited open aperture, the possible waist beam radius will increase if that distance is increased.
Furthermore, there is a maximum to that distance; in the extreme case, the distance equals the effective <a href="rayleigh_length.html" title="Rayleigh length: the distance from a beam waist where the mode radius increased by a factor square root of 2">Rayleigh length</a> of the beam, and the resulting waist beam radius will be smaller than the beam radius at the focusing optics by the square root of 2 (&asymp;1.41).
One can thus easily calculate the Rayleigh length based on the initial beam radius and thus the maximum focusing distance.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Experimental Characterization of Laser Beams</h2>
<div>
<p>There are various devices and techniques for characterizing a laser beam in various respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total optical power carried by a laser beam can be measured with a <a href="powermeters.html" title="powermeters: devices for optical power measurements, based e.g. on heating of an absorber structure">powermeter</a>.
There are also energy meters for measuring <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="pulse energy: energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a> of <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulsed</a> <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a>.</li>
<li>The intensity profile (irradiance profile) can be measured with some kind of <a href="beam_profilers.html" title="beam profilers: devices for measuring the intensity profile of a laser beam">beam profiler</a>, which may be based on a camera.
Some laser beams exhibit &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo;, i.e., regions with higher intensity, which may play role in <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damage</a> phenomena.
There can also be satellite structures, halos and other deviations from beam uniformity.
Note that the shape of the beam intensity profile may change during propagation, and is also not always stable over time.</li>
<li>Some devices do not measure the whole beam profile, but only a <a href="beam_radius.html" title="beam radius: a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> or diameter.
Note that the beam radius is usually not defined as a half width at half maximum (HWHM) value, but as the radial position where the intensity falls to 1/e<sup>2</sup> times the peak intensity.
This comes from the context of <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="Gaussian beams: light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beams</a>.</li>
<li>Wavefront sensors, for example of the Shack&ndash;Hartmann type, can be used to measure the shape of the optical wavefronts.</li>
<li>The <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> (<a href="m2_factor.html" title="<i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor: a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a>) can be calculated from multiple intensity profiles or from intensity and wavefront measurements at one location only.</li>
<li>A laser beam may exhibit <a href="beam_pointing_fluctuations.html" title="beam pointing fluctuations: fluctuations of the propagation direction of a laser beam">beam pointing fluctuations</a>, which can be measured by monitoring the position (center of gravity of the intensity distribution) at a suitable location.</li>
<li>The <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">polarization state</a> maybe roughly characterized based on the power transmission of a <a href="polarizers.html" title="polarizers: optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizer</a> for different orientations, or more completely with various techniques for polarimetry.</li>
</ul>
<p>For many <a href="laser_applications.html" title="laser applications: applications involving laser devices">laser applications</a>, it is essential to have proper means for beam diagnostics, as many possible problems can be identified with such instruments.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:20px;">Stand up for Science!</h2>
<p style="font-size:14px;">It is acceptable that some don't know much about photons, biological evolution or global warming.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">But we don't want bigot ignorants to make political decisions and educate our children!</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">For example, <b>global warming</b> is not a matter of political opinion, but a fact. Ruthless profiteers are leading astray uneducated people, seducing them to take utterly irresponsible positions. <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">But we cannot risk catastrophic climate changes!</span> Science tells us it is high time to act. Read, for example, the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/">IPCC Synthesis Report 2014</a>.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold;">Stand up for science (perhaps by joining a <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com/">March for Science</a>) &ndash; it's our future!</p>
