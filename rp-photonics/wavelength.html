<p>The simplest kind of wave is a monochromatic plane wave, described by the following complex wave amplitude, being a function of spatial position <span class="eqn_il"><i>x</i></span> and time <span class="eqn_il"><i>t</i></span>:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/plane_wave.gif" width="170" height="26" alt="plane wave"></div>
<p>with the <a href="wavenumber.html" title="wavenumber: the phase delay per unit length, or that quantity divided by 2&pi;">wavenumber</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> and the angular frequency <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&omega;</span></span>.
The wavenumber determines the wavelength, defined as the spatial period of the wave (e.g., the distance between subsequent oscillation maxima, see Figure&nbsp;1):</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/lambda.gif" width="72" height="18" alt="wavelength from k"></div>
<figure>
<img src="img/wavelength.gif" alt="plane wave">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A plane wave, with the wavelength illustrated with the black ruler in the middle.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>(Note that in <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy: methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized">spectroscopy</a> the <a href="wavenumber.html" title="wavenumber: the phase delay per unit length, or that quantity divided by 2&pi;">wavenumber</a> is normally considered as the inverse of the wavelength, not involving the factor <span class="eqn_il">2&thinsp;<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span>.)</p>
<p>When propagating by one wavelength in <span class="eqn_il"><i>x</i></span> direction, the plane wave acquires a <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> delay of <span class="eqn_il">2&thinsp;<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span>.</p>
<p>Wavelength and <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="optical frequency: the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">frequency</a> are related to each other: as the wave propagates by one wavelength within one oscillation cycle, its <a href="phase_velocity.html" title="phase velocity: the velocity with which phase fronts propagate in a medium">phase velocity</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>c</i></span> is given by:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/plane_wave_c.gif" width="98" height="18" alt="phase velocity"></div>
<p>For wave packets, there is another kind of velocity, called the <a href="group_velocity.html" title="group velocity: the velocity with which the envelope of a weak narrow-band optical pulse propagates in a medium">group velocity</a>, which can deviate from the phase velocity if there is <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>, i.e., a dependence of the phase velocity on the frequency.</p>
<p>Note that for waves with a different spatial distribution &ndash; for example, for strongly focused <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a>, the amplitude is a function of position is in general not (or not exactly) periodic, and the spacing between subsequent wave maxima may somewhat deviate from the wavelength, which is always defined for a plane wave.
See also the article on the <a href="gouy_phase_shift.html" title="Gouy phase shift: an additional phase shift occurring in the propagation of focused Gaussian beams">Gouy phase shift</a>, which is essentially a phase deviation of <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="Gaussian beams: light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beams</a> against a plane wave for comparison.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Optical Waves: Vacuum Wavelength and the Wavelength in a Medium</h2>
<div>
<p>If a monochromatic optical wave subsequently propagates through different transparent media, its wavelength will vary, while its <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="optical frequency: the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a> <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&nu;</span></span> stays constant.
Therefore, it would be most natural to characterize such a wave by its optical frequency.
For historical reasons, it is more common, however, to characterize optical waves (light) with their <em>vacuum wavelength</em>, i.e., the wavelength which would occur for propagation through vacuum.
Its value is close to the wavelength in air, since air, having a very low density, has only a week influence on the velocity of light; its <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> is only very slightly above 1.</p>
<p>The output wavelength of a quasi-monochromatic light source (e.g., a <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>) is always understood to be a vacuum wavelength.
The wavelength in air is only so slightly smaller that this deviation is not relevant for most applications.</p>
<p>For a given vacuum wavelength <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&lambda;</span><sub>0</sub></span>, the wavelength in a medium with <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> <span class="eqn_il"><i>n</i></span> is <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&lambda;</span>&thinsp;0&thinsp;<span class="greek">&lambda;</span><sub>0</sub>&thinsp;/&thinsp;<i>n</i></span>.
Generally, the refractive index depends on the <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="optical frequency: the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a> or vacuum wavelength (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>).</p>
<p>For visible light, the vacuum wavelength is roughly between 400&nbsp;nm and 700&nbsp;nm; there are no precisely defined boundaries of the visible spectral region, since the sensitivity of the human eye is a smooth function of wavelength and also differs between individuals.
Light with longer vacuum wavelengths is called <a href="infrared_light.html" title="infrared light: invisible light with wavelengths roughly between 750&thinsp;&thinsp;nm and 1&thinsp;&thinsp;mm">infrared light</a>, while light with shorter wavelengths is <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="ultraviolet light: invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet light</a>.</p>
<p>If some physical quantity depends on an optical frequency, it is very often called wavelength-dependent instead of frequency-dependent, even if the spatial aspect does not play a role in the relevant phenomena.</p>
<p>Also one often specifies an optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> (e.g., the <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="gain bandwidth: the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a> of a laser <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a>) in terms of the width of the wavelength range rather than the frequency range.
For the conversion between wavelength and frequency ranges one needs to keep in mind that the width of a frequency interval does not only depend on the width of the corresponding wavelength interval but also on the mean wavelength: <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&delta;</span><span class="greek">&nu;</span>&thinsp;=&thinsp;(<i>c</i>&thinsp;/&thinsp;<span class="greek">&lambda;</span><sup>2</sup>)&thinsp;<span class="greek">&delta;</span><span class="greek">&lambda;</span></span> (assuming small intervals).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Measurement of Optical Wavelengths</h2>
<div>
<p>Optical wavelengths can be measured with <a href="wavemeters.html" title="wavemeters: devices for precise measurements of laser wavelengths">wavemeters</a>, which are a kind of <a href="interferometers.html" title="interferometers: optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometers</a>.
The indirect evaluation of the wavelength from a measured optical frequency and the vacuum <a href="velocity_of_light.html" title="velocity of light: the velocity with which light propagates in a medium">velocity of light</a> can be far more precise, since optical frequencies can be measured with extremely high precision, and the vacuum velocity of light is nowadays (in the SI system) a defined quantity, i.e., without any measurement error.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Non-monochromatic Light</h2>
<div>
<p>In many cases, light is not monochromatic, but rather exhibits a substantial optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.
It is then often of interest to determine how the optical power is distributed over different wavelengths or optical frequencies.
This can be accomplished with <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="optical spectrum: the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> analyzers, ideally delivering a precisely defined <a href="power_spectral_density.html" title="power spectral density: optical power or noise power per unit frequency interval">power spectral density</a> (PSD) versus wavelength of frequency.
The units of such a quantity can be W/nm or W/THz, for example.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Importance of Optical Wavelengths</h2>
<div>
<p>The wavelength of light is relevant for a large number of phenomena.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The longer the wavelength of light, the stronger is its tendency for diffraction, i.e., for the expansion of a light beam (e.g., a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a>).
Because optical wavelength are so short, <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited beams</a>, as are emitted by many <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a>, can exhibit a rather small <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>, i.e., propagate over substantial distances without substantial increase in beam area.
Wavelengths are also relevant in other diffraction phenomena, e.g. at <a href="diffraction_gratings.html" title="diffraction gratings: optical components containing a periodic structure which diffracts light">diffraction gratings</a>.</li>
<li>The wavelength is an essential quantity for any <a href="interference.html" title="interference: a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> phenomena.
Because optical wavelengths are rather short, optical <a href="interferometers.html" title="interferometers: optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometers</a> usually require very high mechanical stability, since even sub-micrometer changes of propagation lengths can substantially modify interference conditions.</li>
<li>Many optical <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> can have substantial effects only if <a href="phase_matching.html" title="phase matching: a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase matching</a> is achieved.
The phase-matching conditions contain the wavelengths of the involved optical beams, and not just the optical frequencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many other cases, the actually irrelevant quantity is the <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="optical frequency: the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>, which of course is related to the wavelength.
For example, resonant effects in the <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="optical pumping: electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">optical pumping</a> of laser-active ions cause strong frequency dependencies.
The wavelengths themselves, being far larger than atoms or ions, are not relevant for those.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Special Types of Wavelengths</h2>
<div>
<p>In optics and <a href="photonics.html" title="photonics: the science and technology of light">photonics</a>, there are many different terms involving the word &ldquo;wavelength&rdquo;.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>emission wavelength</em> of a light source is the vacuum wavelength of the emitted light.</li>
<li>The <em>Bragg wavelength</em> of a <a href="bragg_mirrors.html" title="Bragg mirrors: mirror structures based on Bragg reflection at a period structure">Bragg mirror</a> is the vacuum wavelength for which that mirror has the highest reflectivity.</li>
<li>The <a href="cut_off_wavelength.html" title="cut-off wavelength: a wavelength above which a guided mode of a waveguide ceases to exist"><em>cut-off wavelength</em></a> of a <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> is the vacuum wavelength above which a guided mode ceases to exist.</li>
<li>The <a href="zero_dispersion_wavelength.html" title="zero dispersion wavelength: a wavelength where the group delay dispersion of a fiber or a material is zero"><em>zero dispersion wavelength</em></a> is the vacuum wavelength where the <a href="group_velocity_dispersion.html" title="group velocity dispersion: the frequency dependence of the group velocity in a medium, or (quantitatively) the derivative of the inverse group velocity with respect to angular frequency">group velocity dispersion</a> often optical <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> vanishes.</li>
<li><a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator"><em>Wavelength tuning</em></a> means the modification of the emission wavelength (optical frequency) of a laser, for example.</li>
<li><a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="wavelength division multiplexing: a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain"><em>Wavelength division multiplexing</em></a> is a multiplexing technique operating in the time domain, often used in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>.</li>
