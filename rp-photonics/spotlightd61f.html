<h2>Shortages of rare earth materials &ndash; a problem for photonics?</h2>
<p>Photonics heavily depends on the supply of rare earth materials in various areas &ndash; think of <a href="laser_crystalsd61f.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">laser crystals</a>, <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibersd61f.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">active fibers</a> and <a href="light_emitting_diodesd61f.html?banner=rare_earth_shortage">LEDs</a>, for example.
It is hard to see how such things could be done without rare earth materials.
And those have recently been subject to enormous price increases and were even involved in a trade war.</p>
<p>Is that now a reason for serious concerns in the area of photonics?
Do we need to undertake serious recycling efforts?
