<h1>Glossary of Photonics and Laser Marketing</h1>
<p>Here we explain frequently used terms in the marketing of products in the area of photonics, optics and laser technology.</p>
<table class="marketing_glossary">
<tr><td><a name="a_b_testing">A/B testing</a></td>
<td><p>The effectiveness e.g. of navigation elements on a website for inducing the desired traffic flow can be measured by comparing statistical data e.g. for two different versions of that element (A and B). The results of such A/B tests can be used for optimizing the page performance, e.g. in terms of <a href="marketing_glossary.html#conversion">conversions</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="advertising">advertising</a></td>
<td><p>Activities for making a company and/or its product better known in a positive way, usually with the primary goal of increasing the sales revenue. Advertising can directly aim at sales or at least <a href="marketing_glossary.html#lead_generation">lead generation</a>, but it can also work indirectly by creating a good and well recognizable image of a company and its products (<a href="marketing_glossary.html#branding">branding</a>), which may support later sales.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="anchor_text">anchor text</a></td>
<td><p>The anchor text of a <a href="marketing_glossary.html#hyperlink">hyperlink</a> is the text of that link which is displayed and on which users can <a href="marketing_glossary.html#click">click</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="application_note">application note</a></td>
<td><p>A document describing in some detail how a certain product can be applied for a certain purpose. It may increase the confidence of the reader that the product is suitable for the intended application. Carefully offered application notes can thus be important tools for the product marketing, apart from giving useful support to existing customers.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="attention_span">attention span</a></td>
<td><p>The attention span of a person is the amount of time within which a person is able and prepared to pay attention e.g. to a certain message. It depends on the person itself, e.g. its capabilities and interests, but also substantially on the situation, on the message to which the person is exposed, and on other messages reaching the same person. Particularly persons who are currently pursuing a certain goal may have a very small attention span for messages which are seemingly not related to their current goal.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="audience">audience</a></td>
<td><p>Advertising should always be directed to a well defined audience &ndash; sometimes a relatively broad audience, such as all professional working in optics, photonics and laser technology, and sometimes a very specific audience like professionals reading <a href="encyclopedia.html">encyclopedia</a> articles on certain topics.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="backlink">backlink</a></td>
<td>&rarr; <a href="#inbound_link">inbound link</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="banner">banner</a></td>
<td><p>A graphical element, usually in rectangular form, used for display advertising on websites. The effectiveness of a <a href="marketing_overview.html#banners">banner advertisement</a> depends on many factors, including the qualities of the banner itself (convincing message, appealing visuals etc.), the number of impressions (displays) per month, on its visibility on the pages on which it is placed, on the presence of other advertising banners at that place, on the quality and reputation of those pages, and not least on the characteristics of the reached audience. The cost model is typically either pay per impression or pay per click.</p><p>See our <a href="marketing_overview.html">article on photonics marketing</a>, which has a section on banners, and our <a href="marketing_banners.html">offers for banners</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="bounce_rate">bounce rate</a></td>
<td><p>The bounce rate corresponding to some Internet traffic (e.g., <a href="marketing_glossary.html#referral">referrals</a> from an advertising website to a supplier website) indicates the fraction of visitors who do not request any web pages beyond the first visited page. That may be an indicator for upgrade traffic which is not useful, unless the visitors already can obtain all required information on the first page.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="branding">branding</a></td>
<td><p>Presenting products to a suitable audience in a way which contributes to the creation of a well recognizable brand. The brand recognition can be strongly enhanced with a consistent graphical appearance, including a characteristic company logo and possibly other graphical elements, at suitable places. It can support future sales, even if it does not directly induce sales.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="buyers_guide">buyer's guide</a></td>
<td><p>A resource for reliably finding suppliers for certain products. Typically, suppliers can be registered for free, but paid entries with much improved visibility are available, which can have a substantial effect not only in terms of branding, but also for <a href="marketing_glossary.html#lead_generation">lead generation</a>.</p><p>See the <a href="buyersguide.html">RP Photonics Buyer's Guide</a> &ndash; the only one linked with a famous <a href="encyclopedia.html">encyclopedia</a>!</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="call_to_action">call to action</a></td>
<td><p>In texts for marketing purposes, e.g. in printed form or on a web page, one often includes a &ldquo;call to action&rdquo; (in the form of text or sometimes a graphical element) which is designed to motivate readers to perform a certain action, such as doing a purchase or something at least leaving in that direction &ndash; for example, registering for a <a href="marketing_glossary.html#newsletter">newsletter</a>, downloading a document or analyzing something.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="circulation">circulation</a></td>
<td><p>A circulation number indicates the typical number of copies of some printed item which are distributed. Circulation data are relevant for advertisers. For increased trust, the data can be independently certified by certain agencies.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="click">click</a></td>
<td><p>The action of a website user to click on a certain element in the browser display. In most cases, a click on an HTML link is meant. Such a click may cause a <a href="marketing_glossary.html#website_visit">visit</a> on another website, e.g. that of a supplier.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="content_marketing">content marketing</a></td>
<td><p>A kind of online marketing which involves the creation of certain content, for example an article, <a href="marketing_glossary.html#white_paper">white paper</a>, <a href="marketing_glossary.html#application_note">application note</a> or video on a topic related to the advertised product. Sometimes, such content is marked as sponsored. Sponsored <a href="marketing_glossary.html#webinar">webinars</a> can also be considered as content marketing.</p><p>Placing advertisements in our <a href="encyclopedia.html">encyclopedia</a> (e.g. with <a href="marketing_promotions.html">special promotions</a>) is not considered as content marketing, because that content is not specifically produced for advertising purposes.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="conversion">conversion</a></td>
<td><p>The completion of a desired activity of a user on a website, e.g. an online purchase, a <a href="marketing_glossary.html#website_visit">visit</a> on another webpage, or a document download.</p><p>The fraction of visitors to a certain page whole do a certain conversion can be called a <em>conversion rate</em>. This is often taken as a measure for the effectiveness of a page in producing certain desired results. One should not overlooked, however, that website visits can have multiple beneficial effects, some of which are not measurable; looking at conversion rates only may therefore be misleading.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="core_value_proposition">core value proposition</a></td>
<td>&rarr; <a href="#value_proposition">value proposition</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="cost_per_click">cost per click</a></td>
<td><p>The cost of an advertising campaign divided by the number of <a href="marketing_glossary.html#referral">referrals</a> (<a href="marketing_glossary.html#click">clicks</a>) which it generates. This value can give an indication on how expensive an advertising tool is for generating <a href="marketing_glossary.html#website_visit">website visits</a>. Note, however, that a website visit is not necessarily a <a href="marketing_glossary.html#lead">lead</a>; the quality of the obtained traffic needs to be taken into account.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="cost_per_lead">cost per lead</a></td>
<td><p>The cost of an advertising campaign divided by the number of <a href="marketing_glossary.html#sales_lead">sales leads</a> which it generates. This value can give an indication on how expensive an advertising tool is. However, <a href="marketing_glossary.html#lead_generation">lead generation</a> is usually not the only function of an advertising tool; one should not overlook other functions such as <a href="marketing_glossary.html#branding">branding</a>. Also, the quality of sales leads can vary a lot.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="cpc">CPC</a></td>
<td>&rarr; <a href="#cost_per_click">cost per click</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="cta">CTA</a></td>
<td>&rarr; <a href="#call_to_action">call to action</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="e_mail_campaign">e-mail campaign</a></td>
<td>&rarr; <a href="#mailing">mailing</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="exhibition">exhibition</a></td>
<td><p>An event where certain items &ndash; for example products of a certain industry &ndash; can be showcased. Large exhibitions are organized in the form of <a href="marketing_glossary.html#trade_show">trade shows</a>, but there are also smaller exhibitions associated with technical and scientific conferences.</p><p>See our <a href="marketing_exhibitions.html">article on marketing with exhibitions</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="follow_up">follow-up</a></td>
<td><p>After some interaction e.g. with a potential customer, one often does not simply wait for further actions of that person, but rather contacts the person again after a certain time. For example, one may ask whether there is still an interest in the product, whether they are remaining questions or doubts, etc. One may also ask for feedback, offer a present or undertake something else to strengthen the contact.</p><p>Follow-ups are often systematically applied in marketing. For example, they may be automatically scheduled after an interaction with a potential customer. Of course, there is a risk of irritating potential customers with too frequent or inappropriate follow-ups, which may substantially depend on the cultural context.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="geo_targeting">geo-targeting</a></td>
<td><p>The presentation of online advertisements to people only at specific locations, for example in certain countries. This can be useful particularly for suppliers who are selling only in certain countries.</p><p>For example, RP Photonics offers <a href="marketing_banners.html">advertising banners</a> which can be displayed only in certain countries.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="html_link">HTML link</a></td>
<td><p>A <a href="marketing_glossary.html#hyperlink">hyperlink</a> in a web document, realized with HTML code. (Most hyperlinks are realized with HTML, but one might also use JavaScript code, for example, to obtain the same functionality.)</p><p>Links to a supplier website may not only lead traffic to that website, but also be interpreted by <a href="marketing_glossary.html#search_engine">search engines</a> as an endorsement, which may lead to an increased <a href="marketing_glossary.html#search_engine_ranking">search engine ranking</a> if it is not a <a href="marketing_glossary.html#nofollow_link">nofollow link</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="hyperlink">hyperlink</a></td>
<td><p>An element in a text on a webpage which functions as a reference to some other page or document, to which the user can usually get simply by <a href="marketing_glossary.html#click">clicking</a> on the hyperlink.</p><p>Most hyperlinks are realized as <a href="marketing_glossary.html#html_link">HTML links</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="inbound_link">inbound link</a></td>
<td><p>A link from another website to the own one; also often called &ldquo;backlink&rdquo;, even if there is no link in the other direction (explaining &ldquo;back&rdquo;).</p><p>Inbound links do not only lead direct traffic to a website, but may also enhance its <a href="marketing_glossary.html#search_engine_ranking">search engine ranking</a> if certain conditions are fulfilled (number of such links, authority and relevance for the topic of the other pages, anchor texts etc.).</p><p>Therefore, they may also indirectly lead to enhanced web traffic.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="lead_generation">lead generation</a></td>
<td><p>Generating an interest of potential buyers such that they contact the supplier &ndash; not necessarily with direct orders, but also with inquiries expressing a concrete interest.</p><p>See also <a href="marketing_glossary.html#sales_lead">sales lead</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="landing_page">landing page</a></td>
<td><p>A web page to which visitors from a certain advertising campaign are sent. Frequently, this is a <em>custom landing page</em>, i.e., a page used only for that campaign.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="link">link</a></td>
<td>&rarr; <a href="#html_link">HTML link</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="list_rental">list rental</a></td>
<td><p>The use of a large database of contacts e.g. from a publisher for <a href="marketing_glossary.html#mailing">mailings</a>. Typically, an advertiser gives the message to the publisher, who will send it to selected contacts from a database, but without giving the used e-mail addresses to the advertising customer. It is also possible that the publisher later sends additional messages to the same people, where the content and subject line may depend on whether the addressed people have opened the mail or clicked on any links therein.</p><p>List rental is a method for generating contacts outside the own database, thus reaching out to a larger audience.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="mailing">mailing</a></td>
<td><p>The distribution of some message either in printed form by regular mail or in electronic form, usually by e-mail. Mailings can be effective marketing tools, but only when they are optimized in various respects. They can be done based on an own address pool or through certain services providing many addresses of a hopefully suitable audience.</p><p>See our <a href="marketing_mail.html">article on marketing with mailings</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="media_data">media data</a></td>
<td><p>Data which characterize some tools used for advertising. Beyond solid data such as <a href="marketing_glossary.html#circulation">circulation</a> number and <a href="marketing_glossary.html#web_statistics">web statistics</a>, they can contain descriptions of the medium and its audience, as are relevant for advertisers.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="mobile_friendly_web_design">mobile-friendly web design</a></td>
<td>&rarr; <a href="#responsive_design">responsive design</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="native_advertising">native advertising</a></td>
<td><p>The attempt to improve the effectiveness of advertisements (print or online) by embedding them into related editorial content in a form which is matched to that content. For example, online advertisements may be placed close to editorial content without graphically distinguishing them much from that content.</p><p>This method may reduce detrimental effects like &ldquo;banner blindness&rdquo;, but it can have inappropriate manipulative effects with ethical implications, particularly when the line between advertisements and editorial content is blurred such that advertising messages can be wrongly perceived as an endorsement by the author of the actual article.</p><p>Our <a href="marketing_print.html">article on print advertising</a> contains some further thoughts on that method.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="newsletter">newsletter</a></td>
<td><p>A regularly appearing publication, which is sent to people who have subscribed to its distribution list. Companies may build up their own distribution list, but it is also possible to add paid advertisements to newsletters of certain publishers.</p><p>See our <a href="marketing_mail.html">article on mailings</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="nofollow_link">nofollow link</a></td>
<td><p>A HTML link with the attribute rel=&ldquo;nofollow&rdquo;, which indicates to search engines that the link is not to be interpreted as an endorsement. The link will then have no influence on the <a href="marketing_glossary.html#search_engine_ranking">search engine ranking</a> of the target page.</p><p>In <a href="marketing_glossary.html#buyers_guide">buyer's guides</a>, links to supplier pages are often realized as nofollow links (or not even as <a href="marketing_glossary.html#html_link">HTML links</a>), since search engines may &ldquo;punish&rdquo; websites for paid links.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="organic_search_results">organic search results</a></td>
<td><p>Traffic from <a href="marketing_glossary.html#search_engines">search engines</a> can be obtained through paid advertising, but it can also be obtained based on the natural <a href="marketing_glossary.html#search_engine_ranking">search engine ranking</a> of the own website. In the latter case, one obtains organic search results in contrast to paid results.</p><p>Obviously, it is desirable to obtain a lot of organic search engine traffic, since that is likely to last without further expenses.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="page_impression">page impression</a></td>
<td>&rarr; <a href="#page_view">page view</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="page_view">page view</a></td>
<td><p>Each time when a web page is requested by a browser program, this is counted as a page view. For obtaining meaningful data, page requests from search engine robots and the like need to be filtered out.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="pay_per_click">pay per click</a></td>
<td><p>This is a frequently used cost model for online advertising, where the cost of the advertising depends on the number of <a href="marketing_glossary.html#click">clicks</a> on certain <a href="marketing_glossary.html#hyperlink">hyperlinks</a> which typically lead users to certain <a href="marketing_glossary.html#landing_page">landing pages</a>.</p><p>In addition to the <a href="marketing_glossary.html#cost_per_click">cost per click</a> (CPC), there may be an agreed maximum daily or overall budget in order to create an upper boundary of the possible cost.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="ppc">PPC</a></td>
<td>&rarr; <a href="#pay_per_click">pay per click</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="print_advertising">print advertising</a></td>
<td><p>The use of printed materials for advertising &ndash; either for direct use e.g. as handouts in exhibitions or for mailings.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="privacy_regulations">privacy regulations</a></td>
<td><p>Online marketing can easily collide with regulations concerning the privacy of users, particularly when trying to implement very <a href="marketing_glossary.html#targeted_advertising">targeted advertising</a>. For example, privacy regulations are often violated on <a href="marketing_glossary.html#social_media">social media</a> platforms, when using <a href="marketing_glossary.html#user_tracking">user tracking</a> on website, and when collecting e-mail addresses for <a href="marketing_glossary.html#mailing">mailings</a>.</p><p>RP Photonics can offer very targeted advertising, for example in the form of <a href="marketing_promotions.html">special promotions</a> placed in <a href="encyclopedia.html">encyclopedia</a> articles, but never touching the privacy of users.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="promotion">promotion</a></td>
<td><p>A measure which is intended to make a product better known and to subsequently increase the number of its sales. Product promotions can be realized in many forms, including <a href="marketing_glossary.html#banner">banner</a> advertisements, targeted communications through special websites or social media, and mailings.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="quality_of_traffic">quality of traffic</a></td>
<td><p>The value of Internet traffic, for example coming from a <a href="marketing_glossary.html#buyers_guide">buyer's guide</a> to a supplier website, depends not only on the number of <a href="marketing_glossary.html#website_visit">visits</a> per month, but also on the quality of traffic. For example, it would not serve the purpose to obtain visits from many users for whom the website is of no interest. Metrics for the quality of traffic can include the <a href="marketing_glossary.html#bounce_rate">bounce rate</a> and the average number of page views within a certain time interval.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="referral">referral</a></td>
<td><p>Generally, a referral on a website means that a reader is motivated to visit a page on another website by clicking on a <a href="marketing_glossary.html#hyperlink">hyperlink</a>. In case of advertising, the number of referrals in a month is an indicator for the effectiveness. However, the quality of the obtained traffic is also very relevant.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="responsive_design">responsive design</a></td>
<td><p>A website design which automatically adapts to the size of the display window of the browser such that it works well with a wide range of window sizes. Responsive web design is normally also mobile-friendly, i.e., usable with mobile devices like tablets and smartphones.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="sales_lead">sales lead</a></td>
<td><p>A sales lead is a contact to a potential customer. For example, product inquiries via e-mail or a contact form on a web page can be considered as sales leads. The quality of sales leads is essentially related to the chances that a later sale can indeed be realized with the given contact person, and it can of course vary a lot. For example, the quality of sales leads generated in the form of <a href="marketing_glossary.html#website_visit">website visits</a> through <a href="marketing_glossary.html#html_link">HTML links</a> on another website strongly depend on the audience of that website.</p><p>Sales leads are often managed in a systematic way (lead management). For example, leads of a certain type are registered for <a href="marketing_glossary.html#follow_up">follow-up</a> messages after a defined time delay.</p><p>See also <a href="marketing_glossary.html#lead_generation">lead generation</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="search_advertising">search advertising</a></td>
<td><p>A method of improving the chances of a website or particular web pages to be found in searches with Internet <a href="marketing_glossary.html#search_engine">search engines</a>. The most widely used service of that type is Google Ads.</p><p>See our <a href="marketing_adwords.html">article on search marketing</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="search_engine">search engine</a></td>
<td><p>An Internet search engine contains (a) so-called search engine robots, which collect huge amounts of information from web pages, (b) a large database (search index) storing such information, and (c) an interface for accepting search inquiries from users and delivering the search results. They use sophisticated algorithms for deciding which of the many web pages containing certain keywords are listed with what priority in the search results.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="search_engine_optimization_(seo)">search engine optimization (SEO)</a></td>
<td><p>The application of various methods with the goal to improve the <a href="marketing_glossary.html#search_engine_ranking">search engine ranking</a> of a website for certain keywords.</p><p>Some &ldquo;black hat&rdquo; SEO methods aim at manipulating search engines for their purposes, but search engines are employing better and better algorithms for detecting such attempts. Nowadays, the volume and quality of the content of the website &ndash; together with external endorsements in the form of inbound links &ndash; are the primary factor for search engine ranking. Search engine optimization should thus primarily be work on the content, plus the observation of various issues such as the proper use of important keywords.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="search_engine_ranking">search engine ranking</a></td>
<td><p>The ranking of a certain website or a particular web page in the search results of <a href="marketing_glossary.html#search_engine">search engines</a> in general or some particular search engine. That ranking is often a vital factor for obtaining traffic to a website. It depends on many aspects of the website, in particular of its volume and quality of content. Search engines use many criteria for determining such rankings, including the number and quality of links to a website from other websites.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="search_engine_robot">search engine robot</a></td>
