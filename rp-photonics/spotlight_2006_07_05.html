<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="laser_development.html" title="laser development: the process of developing a laser device">laser development</a> and <a href="laser_design.html" title="laser design: the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a></p>
<p>Everyone has heard about such laser development projects which develop into a nightmare, with nasty unexpected problems, requiring measures which cure one problem while exacerbating another one, finally leading to time-consuming revisions, so that the market entry is delayed further and further. 
The resulting costs are enormous: not only spending many additional man months and keeping the costly infrastructure occupied with that project, but also delaying the time where the product brings revenue, apart from losing the waiting customers' confidence.
In the worst case, a competitor uses the time to get his product placed &hellip;</p>
<p>The origin of such problems is probably very often related to the role attributed to <a href="laser_design.html" title="laser design: the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">laser design</a> within the <a href="laser_development.html" title="laser development: the process of developing a laser device">laser development</a>.
Laser design appears frequently to be considered as a kind of side product of the development work, perhaps just written up some time after the actual development; the work itself is based on some degree of experience, some reasonable principles (e.g. trying it out step by step), but to some significant extent also on trial and error.</p>
<p>The cure is then to redefine the role of laser design to <em>support the lab work</em> rather than just to somehow result from it.
Obviously, for that purpose it has to be developed first &ndash; not in the lab, but <em>on the desk</em>.
This involves quantitative checks of the central issues; not necessarily full-blown numerical <a href="laser_modeling.html" title="laser modeling: the investigation of phenomena and quantitative relations in lasers, using theoretical models and computational methods">modeling</a>, but at least a number of relatively simple calculations e.g. concerning the required pump and laser intensities, the laser gain and optimum output coupler transmission, the balance of pulse-shaping effects (in a <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked laser</a>), etc.
When problems are identified at this stage, they will often not require more than a few hours to be solved.
In the lab, this process is much more costly: it is often far more difficult to correctly diagnose a problem there, and more tedious to try out various measures.</p>
<p>The deliverable of the laser design work is a clear <em>design report</em>, to be discussed with all the involved engineers.
Of course, there can still be unexpected problems, but the likelihood of significant delays can be strongly reduced with proper preparations.</p>
<p>Particularly in smaller laser companies, there are plenty of possible reasons why resources are wasted by engaging in prototype building without being properly prepared:</p>
<ul>
<li>the lack of an internal expert with sufficient physics knowledge and experience,</li>
<li>the cost of getting an external laser expert to do (or check) the design work (even though this is nearly negligible compared with the damage of a nightmare project as described above),</li>
<li>the anxiety to keep the expertise in house (even though few things may push the in-house expertise as much as reading and discussing good design reports),</li>
<li>and certain psychological barriers preventing people from learning from disastrous experience.
(Interestingly, some people prefer to &ldquo;explain&rdquo; the phenomenon with &ldquo;Murphy's law&rdquo;, &ldquo;that's life&rdquo;, etc., rather than doing something about it!)</li>
</ul>
<p>But be assured that the really successful laser companies have learned to deal with these obstacles and are always making sure that an experienced expert &ndash; whether in house or hired as a consultant &ndash; takes care of the critical design stages from the beginning.</p>

<h2>The Transparent Laser</h2>
<p>The dream of each laser developer, and not only of each laser scientist: have a <b>transparent laser</b>, where you can <b>look into any components</b> and see e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>optical intensities</li>
<li>excitation densities of laser-active ions</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and this at any location and time, with arbitrary resolution!</p>
<p>If you had this, finally you could</p>
<ul>
<li>fully understand what goes on in your laser,</li>
<li>quickly identify and fix any problems, and</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">make faster progress <br> while saving a lot of money.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely marvelous, but only a dream?!?</p>
<p>Good news: such transparent lasers can be made!
