<p>(British spelling: fibre lasers)</p>
<p>Fiber lasers are usually meant to be <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">lasers</a> with <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">optical fibers</a> as <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain media</a>, although some lasers with a <a href="semiconductor_lasers.html" title="semiconductor lasers: lasers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor gain medium</a> (a <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="semiconductor optical amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifier</a>) and a fiber <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> have also been called fiber lasers (or <em>semiconductor fiber lasers</em>).
Also, devices containing some kind of laser (e.g., a <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled laser diodes</a>) and a <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a> are often called fiber lasers (or fiber laser systems).</p>
<p>In most cases, the gain medium is a <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">fiber doped with rare earth ions</a> such as <a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="erbium-doped gain media: laser gain media doped with erbium ions">erbium</a> (Er<sup>3+</sup>), <a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="neodymium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium</a> (Nd<sup>3+</sup>), <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="ytterbium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium</a> (Yb<sup>3+</sup>), thulium (Tm<sup>3+</sup>), or praseodymium (Pr<sup>3+</sup>), and one or several <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled laser diodes</a> are used for pumping.
Therefore, most fiber lasers are <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="diode-pumped lasers: solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes"><em>diode-pumped lasers</em></a>.
Although the gain media fiber lasers are similar to those of <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>, the waveguiding effect and the small <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">effective mode area</a> usually lead to substantially different properties of the lasers.
For example, they often operate with much higher laser <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> and <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">resonator</a> losses.

<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Laser Resonators</h2>
<div>
<p>In order to form a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> with fibers, one either needs some kind of reflector (mirror) to form a linear resonator, or one builds a fiber <a href="ring_lasers.html" title="ring lasers: lasers with a ring resonator">ring laser</a>.
Various types of mirrors are used in linear fiber laser resonators:</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:282px;">
<img src="img/ml_erbium_fiber_laser.png" alt="setup of ultrafast erbium fiber laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A simple erbium-doped femtosecond laser, where the Fresnel reflection from a fiber end is used for output coupling.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>In simple laboratory setups, ordinary <a href="dielectric_mirrors.html" title="dielectric mirrors: mirrors consisting of multiple thin layers of different transparent optical materials">dielectric mirrors</a> can be butted to the perpendicularly cleaved fiber ends, as shown in Figure&nbsp;5.
This approach, however, is not very practical for mass fabrication and not very durable either.</li>
<li>The Fresnel reflection from a bare fiber end face is often sufficient for the <a href="output_couplers.html" title="output couplers: partially transparent laser mirrors, used for extracting output beams from laser resonators">output coupler</a> of a fiber laser.
Figure&nbsp;1 shows an example.</li>
<li>It is also possible to deposit dielectric coatings directly on fiber ends, usually with some evaporation method.
Such coatings can be used to realize reflectivities in a wide range.</li>
<li>For commercial products, it is common to use <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a>, made either directly in the doped fiber, or in an undoped fiber which is spliced to the active fiber.
Figure&nbsp;2 shows a <a href="distributed_bragg_reflector_lasers.html" title="distributed Bragg reflector lasers: lasers containing distributed Bragg reflectors as end mirrors">distributed Bragg reflector laser</a> (DBR laser) with two fiber gratings, but there are also <a href="distributed_feedback_lasers.html" title="distributed feedback lasers: lasers where the whole laser resonator consists of a periodic structure, in which Bragg reflection occurs">distributed feedback lasers</a> with a single grating in doped fiber, with a <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> shift in the middle.</li>
</ul>

<li>A better power-handling capability is achieved by collimating the light exiting the fiber with a <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a> and reflecting it back with a dielectric mirror (Figure&nbsp;3).
The <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical intensity: optical power per unit area">intensities</a> on the mirror are then greatly reduced due to the much larger beam area.
However, slight misalignment can cause substantial reflection losses, and the additional Fresnel reflection at the fiber end can introduce filter effects and the like.
The latter effects can be suppressed by using angle-cleaved fiber ends, which however introduce polarization-dependent losses.</li>
</ul>

<img src="img/fiber_loop.png" alt="fiber loop">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span>

<ul>
<li>Another option is to form a <a href="fiber_loop_mirrors.html" title="fiber loop mirrors: fiber loops which act as mirrors">fiber loop mirror</a> (Figure&nbsp;4), based on a <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber couplers: fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber coupler</a> (e.g. with 50:50 splitting ratio) and some piece of passive fiber.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most fiber lasers are pumped with one or several <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled diode lasers</a>.
The pump light may be coupled directly into the core, or in <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power</a> into a larger pump cladding (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light"><em>double-clad fibers</em></a>), as discussed below in more detail.</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of fiber lasers, some of which are discussed in the following.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">High-power Fiber Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>Whereas the first fiber lasers could deliver only a few milliwatts of output power, there are now <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber lasers</a> with output powers of hundreds of watts, sometimes even several kilowatts from a single fiber.
This potential arises from a high surface-to-volume ratio (avoiding excessive heating) and the guiding effect, which avoids thermo-optical problems even under conditions of significant heating.</p>
<p>See the article on <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Upconversion Fiber Lasers</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:249px;">
<img src="img/thulium_levels.png" alt="upconversion in Tm:ZBLAN fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;6:</span> 
Level scheme of thulium (Tm<sup>3+</sup>) ions in ZBLAN fiber, showing how excitation with an 1140-nm laser can lead to blue fluorescence and laser emission.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The fiber laser concept is most suitable for the realization of <a href="upconversion_lasers.html" title="upconversion lasers: lasers relying on upconversion processes">upconversion lasers</a>, as these often have to operate on relatively &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; <a href="laser_transitions.html" title="laser transitions: optical transitions where stimulated emission is used to obtain optical amplification">laser transitions</a>, requiring high pump intensities.
In a fiber laser, such high pump intensities can be easily maintained over a long length, so that the <a href="gain_efficiency.html" title="gain efficiency: small-signal gain of an optical amplifier per unit pump power or per unit stored energy">gain efficiency</a> achievable often makes it easy to operate even on low-gain transitions.</p>
<p>In most cases, silica glass is not suitable for upconversion fiber lasers, because the upconversion scheme requires relatively long lifetimes of intermediate electronic levels, and such lifetimes are often very small in silica fibers due to the relatively large phonon energy of silica glass (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="multi_phonon_transitions.html" title="multi-phonon transitions: transitions between electronic levels of atoms or ions in solid media, involving the emission of multiple phonons"><em>multi-phonon transitions</em></a>).
Therefore, one mostly uses certain heavy-metal <a href="fluoride_fibers.html" title="fluoride fibers: optical fibers based on fluoride glasses">fluoride fibers</a> such as ZBLAN (a fluorozirconate) with low phonon energies.</p>
<p>The probably most popular upconversion fiber lasers are based on thulium-doped fibers for blue light generation (Figure&nbsp;6), praseodymium-doped lasers (possibly with ytterbium codoping) for red, orange, green or blue output, and green erbium-doped lasers.</p>
<p>See the article on <a href="upconversion_lasers.html" title="upconversion lasers: lasers relying on upconversion processes">upconversion lasers</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Narrow-linewidth Fiber Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>Fiber lasers can be constructed to operate on a single longitudinal mode (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="single-frequency lasers: lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode"><em>single-frequency lasers</em></a>, <a href="single_mode_operation.html" title="single-mode operation: operation of a laser on axial (longitudinal) resonator modes only, or even on a single axial mode"><em>single-mode operation</em></a>) with a very narrow <a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> of a few kilohertz or even below 1&nbsp;kHz.
In order to achieve long-term stable single-frequency operation without excessive requirements concerning temperature stability, one usually has to keep the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> relatively short (e.g. of the order of 5&nbsp;cm), even though a longer resonator would in principle allow for even lower <a href="phase_noise.html" title="phase noise: noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">phase noise</a> and a correspondingly smaller <a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a>.
The fiber ends have narrow-bandwidth <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="distributed_bragg_reflector_lasers.html" title="distributed Bragg reflector lasers: lasers containing distributed Bragg reflectors as end mirrors"><em>distributed Bragg reflector lasers</em></a>, <em>DBR fiber lasers</em>), selecting a single <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="resonator modes: modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator mode</a>.
Typical output powers are a few milliwatts to some tens of milliwatts, although single-frequency fiber lasers with up to roughly 1&nbsp;W output power have also been demonstrated.</p>
<p>An extreme form is the <a href="distributed_feedback_lasers.html" title="distributed feedback lasers: lasers where the whole laser resonator consists of a periodic structure, in which Bragg reflection occurs">distributed-feedback laser</a> (DFB laser), where the whole <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> is contained in a fiber Bragg grating with a phase shift in the middle.
Here, the resonator is fairly short, which can compromise the output power and linewidth, but single-frequency operation is very stable.</p>
<p>Of course, further amplification to much higher power levels in a <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a> is possible.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Q-switched Fiber Lasers</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:282px;">
<img src="img/ml_erbium_fiber_laser.png" alt="setup of Q-switched erbium fiber laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;7:</span> 
Simple Q-switched fiber laser. The setup looks exactly the same as that of a mode-locked laser as shown above (Figure&nbsp;2), but the SESAM parameters are different.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With various methods of active or passive <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a>, fiber lasers can be used for generating <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a> with <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="pulse duration: the duration of an optical pulse">durations</a> which are typically between tens and hundreds of nanoseconds (see e.g. Fig.&nbsp;7).
The <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="pulse energy: energy of an optical pulse">pulse energy</a> achievable with <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fibers</a> can be several millijoules, in extreme cases tens of millijoules, and is essentially limited by the <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="saturation energy: a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation energy</a> (even for <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fibers</a>) and by the <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damage threshold</a> (the latter particularly for shorter pulses).
All-fiber setups (not containing any free-space optics) are quite limited in terms of the achievable pulse energy, as they can normally not be realized with <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fibers</a> and effective <a href="q_switches.html" title="Q switches: optical switches which are typically used for generating nanosecond pulses in lasers">Q switches</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the high laser <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, the details of Q switching a fiber laser are often qualitatively different from those of a <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk laser</a>, and more complicated.
One often obtains a temporal sub-structure with multiple sharp spikes, and there is a possibility of producing Q-switched pulses with a duration well below the (typically long) resonator round-trip time.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Raman Fiber Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>A special type of fiber lasers are fiber <a href="raman_lasers.html" title="Raman lasers: lasers based on Raman gain rather than on laser gain from stimulated emission">Raman lasers</a>, relying on <a href="raman_gain.html" title="Raman gain: optical gain arising from stimulated Raman scattering">Raman gain</a> associated with the fiber <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearity</a>.
Such lasers usually use relatively long fibers, sometimes of a type with increased nonlinearity, and typical pump powers of the order of 1&nbsp;W.
With several nested pairs of <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a>, the Raman conversion can be done in several steps, bridging hundreds of nanometers between the pump and output <a href="wavelength.html" title="wavelength: the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a>.

</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Lasers with Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers</h2>
<div>
<p>There are some lasers which have a <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="semiconductor optical amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifier</a> (SOA) as the gain medium in a resonator made of fibers.
Even though the actual laser process does not occur in a fiber, such fibers are sometimes called fiber lasers.
They typically emit relatively small <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>s of a few milliwatts or even less.
Sometimes they exploit the very different properties of the semiconductor gain medium, as compared with a <a href="rare_earth_doped_gain_media.html" title="rare-earth-doped gain media: laser gain media which are doped with rare earth ions">rare-earth-doped</a> fiber, in particular the much smaller <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="saturation energy: a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation energy</a> and <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="upper-state lifetime: the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a>.
Rather than only generating coherent light, such lasers can be used for information processing in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> systems &ndash; for example the wavelength conversion of data channels based on cross-saturation effects.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Special Attractions of Fibers as Laser Gain Media</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>As fibers can be coiled and the light propagating in fibers is well shielded from the environment (e.g. concerning dust), fiber lasers can have a compact and rugged setup, provided that the whole <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> is built only with fiber components (<em>all-fiber setup</em>) such as <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg gratings</a> and <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber couplers: fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a> (i.e., avoiding free-space optics and any requirement for alignment).</li>
<li>Fiber gain media have a large <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="gain bandwidth: the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a> due to strongly broadened laser transitions in glasses, permitting wide <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tuning</a> ranges and/or the generation of <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>.
Also, fiber lasers have broad spectral regions with good <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="pump absorption: the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a>, making the exact pump wavelength uncritical, so that temperature stabilization of the pump diodes is usually not necessary.</li>
<li><a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">Diffraction-limited</a> <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> is easily obtained when <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a> are used, and sometimes also with slightly multimode fibers.</li>
<li>Due to the high <a href="gain_efficiency.html" title="gain efficiency: small-signal gain of an optical amplifier per unit pump power or per unit stored energy">gain efficiency</a> of doped fibers, fiber lasers have the potential to operate with very small pump powers.
Also, it is possible to obtain very high power efficiencies.</li>
<li>In recent years, the potential for very <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high output powers</a> (several kilowatts with <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a>) has been convincingly demonstrated (see above).</li>
<li>Again due to the guidance, which allows high pump intensities to be applied over long lengths, fiber lasers can be operated even on very &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; laser transitions (e.g. of <a href="upconversion_lasers.html" title="upconversion lasers: lasers relying on upconversion processes">upconversion lasers</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, fiber lasers can suffer from various problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the pump light has to be launched from free space into a single-mode <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a>, the alignment is critical.
This problem can be eliminated by using <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled pump diodes</a>.</li>
<li>Most fibers exhibit a complicated temperature-dependent <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">polarization evolution</a>, unless <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="polarization-maintaining fibers: specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining fibers</a> or Faraday rotators are used.
Such measures, however, are normally not compatible with nonlinear polarization rotation mode locking.</li>
<li><a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">Nonlinear effects</a> often limit the performance, e.g. in terms of powers achievable in <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="single-frequency operation: an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency operation</a> or the pulse quality of <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>.
For example, <a href="kelly_sidebands.html" title="Kelly sidebands: sidebands in the spectrum of certain mode-locked lasers, related to a periodic disturbance of soliton pulses in the laser resonator">Kelly sidebands</a> are often seen, whereas mode-locked <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a> rarely exhibit this effect.</li>
<li>At high powers, there is a risk of fiber damage even below the actual <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damage threshold</a> of the material (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="fiber_fuse.html" title="fiber fuse: the effect that an optical fiber 'burns' from the output end under the influence of an intense laser beam launched into the other end"><em>fiber fuse</em></a>).</li>
<li>Fibers have a limited gain and pump absorption per unit length, making it difficult to realize very short resonators e.g. for <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="single-frequency lasers: lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency lasers</a> or for multi-gigahertz <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked lasers</a>.
However, significant progress has been made in this direction recently via the development of very highly doped fibers, usually made from <a href="phosphate_glasses.html" title="phosphate glasses: certain glasses from which certain optical fibers and laser gain media can be made, for example">phosphate glasses</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note that fiber lasers are in many cases substantially more difficult to <a href="laser_design.html" title="laser design: the design of a laser device, or the process of working out such a design">design</a> than <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>.
This results from very different reasons, including strong saturation effects caused by the high optical intensities, the <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="four-level and three-level gain media: laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level behavior</a> of nearly all fiber <a href="laser_transitions.html" title="laser transitions: optical transitions where stimulated emission is used to obtain optical amplification">laser transitions</a>, and the complicated pulse formation mechanisms in <a href="mode_locked_fiber_lasers.html" title="mode-locked fiber lasers: ultrafast fiber lasers which are actively or passively mode-locked for generating ultrashort pulses">mode-locked fiber lasers</a>.
As a result, the <a href="laser_development.html" title="laser development: the process of developing a laser device">laser development</a> project can be more costly.</p>

<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Laser Modeling</h2>
<div>
<p>Many technical aspects in fiber lasers are significantly more complicated than in <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>.
Reasons for that are manifold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiber lasers are typically operated with a higher <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> and higher resonator losses.</li>
<li>Optical intensities in fiber lasers are often far above the <a href="saturation_power.html" title="saturation power: a measure of the incident optical power required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation intensity</a>, leading to strong saturation effects (even for pump waves).</li>
<li>Most active fibers have <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="four-level and three-level gain media: laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level gain systems</a>, and their operation characteristics are more complicated than those of four-level lasers.</li>
<li>Fiber laser systems are often more complex, for example using <a href="master_oscillator_power_amplifier.html" title="master oscillator power amplifier: a laser system consisting of a seed laser and a laser amplifier for boosting the output power">master oscillator power amplifier</a> architectures.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, the operation details of a fiber laser (or fiber laser system) can often not be understood only based on simple analytical calculations.
Numerical simulations, carried out with some kind of <a href="fiber_simulation_software.html" title="fiber simulation software: software for numerical simulations on fiber devices">fiber simulation software</a>, are therefore required for calculating the possible laser performance, analyzing detrimental effects, and optimizing prototype and product designs.
Such simulations can address many different technical aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="rate_equation_modeling.html" title="rate equation modeling: a method of modeling the dynamics of laser gain media">Rate equation modeling</a> can be used for calculating the behavior of single laser-active ions, or combinations of ions involving <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="energy transfer: the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfer</a> processes.</li>
<li>A mode solver, i.e., a calculator for fiber <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a>, can produce inputs for further calculations &ndash; in particular, mode intensity profiles.</li>
<li>In some situations, numerical beam propagation is of interest.
For example, this is often the case for highly multimode fibers, including the pump claddings of <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a>.</li>
<li>Refined algorithms are required for calculating the steady state of lasers and amplifiers, with a self-consistent solution for optical intensities and excitation densities of laser-active ions throughout the fiber.
(Note that optical intensities and excitation densities mutually influence each other.)</li>
<li>Dynamical models are used for calculating pulse amplification and <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a>, for example.</li>
<li><a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">Ultrashort pulse</a> propagation in fibers can also be numerically simulated under the influence of effects like laser <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, the limited <a href="gain_bandwidth.html" title="gain bandwidth: the width of the optical frequency range in which significant gain is available from an amplifier">gain bandwidth</a>, <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>, various <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example for surprising features even of simple fiber lasers, Figure&nbsp;9 shows the <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> and excitation densities along the fiber of an Yb-doped single-mode fiber laser.
A <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg grating</a> with 25&#37; peak reflectivity at 1030&nbsp;nm on the right side serves as the output coupler, whereas a highly reflecting Bragg grating is used on the left side.
The pump light (at 975&nbsp;nm) is coupled in through that grating.
A nearly linear (rather than exponential) decay of pump power on the left side results from strong pump saturation.
The fiber is somewhat over-long, resulting in slight signal reabsorption on the right side.
That reabsorption maintains a significant ytterbium excitation despite the vanishing pump power, but causes only a negligible reduction in signal output power.
Losses via ASE (not shown here) are also negligible.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/yb_fiber_laser1.png" alt="Yb-doped fiber laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;9:</span> 
Optical powers and excitation densities along the fiber of an Yb-doped single-mode fiber laser, core-pumped at 975&nbsp;nm.
Note that the intracavity signal power can be higher than the pump power; only part of that power can be coupled out.
The simulation has been done with the software <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure&nbsp;10 shows the same for a modified output coupler grating, so that lasing occurs at 1080&nbsp;nm.
The lower emission cross-sections at 1080&nbsp;nm lead to a higher degree of Yb excitation and thus to weaker pump absorption.
This demonstrates that the required fiber length depends not only on the absorption characteristics at the pump wavelength, but also on the details for the signal, such as the signal wavelength and the resonator losses.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/yb_fiber_laser2.png" alt="Yb-doped fiber laser">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;10:</span> 
Same as in Figure&nbsp;9, but for a fiber Bragg grating for lasing at 1080&nbsp;nm.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the fiber length in the last case would be reduced to 0.7&nbsp;m, one might expect a moderate reduction in output power due to incomplete pump absorption.
However, a simulation (not shown here) tells that lasing would stop completely, and 94&#37; of the pump power would leave the fiber on the right side.
The Yb excitation density of about 50&#37; throughout the fiber would not be sufficient to reach the <a href="laser_threshold.html" title="laser threshold: an operation condition of a laser where laser emission just starts to occur">laser threshold</a>.
For a reduced pump wavelength of 940&nbsp;nm, however, lasing would be possible again &ndash; despite the reduced pump absorption cross section, because pump saturation effects would be weaker.</p>
