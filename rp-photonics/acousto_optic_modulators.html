<p>An acousto-optic modulator (AOM) is a device which can be used for controlling the power (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="intensity_modulators.html"><em>intensity modulators</em></a>), optical frequency or spatial direction of a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> with an electrical drive signal.
It is based on the acousto-optic effect, i.e. the modification of the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> by the oscillating mechanical pressure of a sound wave.</p>
<p>The key element of an AOM is a transparent crystal (or piece of glass) through which the light propagates.
A piezoelectric transducer attached to the crystal is used to excite a sound wave with a frequency of the order of 100&nbsp;MHz.
Light can then experience Bragg diffraction at the traveling periodic refractive index grating generated by the sound wave; therefore, AOMs are sometimes called <em>Bragg cells</em>.
The <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="optical frequency: the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a> of the scattered beam is increased or decreased by the frequency of the sound wave (depending on the propagation direction of the acoustic wave relative to the beam) and propagates in a slightly different direction.
(The change in direction is smaller than shown in Figure&nbsp;1, because the <a href="wavenumber.html" title="wavenumber: the phase delay per unit length, or that quantity divided by 2&pi;">wavenumber</a> of the sound wave is very small compared with that of the light beam.)
The frequency and direction of the scattered beam can be controlled via the frequency of the sound wave, whereas the acoustic power is the control for the <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a>.
For sufficiently high acoustic power, more than 50&#37; of the optical power can be diffracted &ndash; in extreme cases, even more than 95&#37;.</p>
<figure class="left" style="width:289px;">
<img src="img/aom.png" alt="acousto-optic modulator">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Schematic setup of a non-resonant acousto-optic modulator.
A transducer generates a sound wave, at which a light beam is partially diffracted.
The diffraction angle is exaggerated.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The acoustic wave may be absorbed at the other end of the crystal.
Such a <em>traveling-wave geometry</em> makes it possible to achieve a broad modulation <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of many megahertz.
Other devices are resonant for the sound wave, exploiting the strong reflection of the acoustic wave at the other end of the crystal.
The resonant enhancement can greatly increase the modulation strength (or decrease the required acoustic power), but reduces the modulation <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>.</p>
<p>Common materials for acousto-optic devices are tellurium dioxide (TeO<sub>2</sub>), crystalline quartz, and fused silica.
There are manifold criteria for the choice of the material, including the elasto-optic coefficients, the transparency range, the <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage threshold</a>, and required size.
One may also use different kinds of acoustic waves.
Most common is the use of longitudinal (compression) waves.
These lead to the highest diffraction efficiencies, which however depend on the polarization of the optical beam.
Polarization-independent operation can be obtained when using acoustic shear waves (with the acoustic movement in the direction of the laser beam), which however make the diffraction less efficient.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="integrated_optics.html" title="integrated optics: the technology dealing with the construction of photonic integrated circuits">integrated-optical devices</a> containing one or more acousto-optic modulators on a chip.
This is possible, e.g., with integrated optics on lithium niobate (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>), as this material is piezoelectric, so that a surface-acoustic wave can be generated via metallic electrodes on the chip surface.
Such devices can be used in many ways, e.g. as tunable <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">optical filters</a> or optical switches.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>Acousto-optic modulators find many applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are used for <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a> of <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a>.
The AOM, called <a href="q_switches.html" title="Q switches: optical switches which are typically used for generating nanosecond pulses in lasers">Q switch</a>, then serves to block the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> before the <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulse</a> is generated.
In most cases, the zero-order (not diffracted) beam is used under lasing conditions, and the AOM is turned on when lasing should be prohibited.
This requires that the caused diffraction losses (possibly for two passes per resonator round trip) are higher than the laser <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>.
For high-gain lasers (for example, <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>), one sometimes uses the first-order diffracted beam under lasing conditions, so that very high resonator losses result when the AOM is turned off.
However, the losses in the lasing state are then also fairly high.</li>
<li>AOMs can also be used for <a href="cavity_dumping.html" title="cavity dumping: a method for extracting intense short or ultrashort pulses from a laser, using an optical switch in the laser resonator">cavity dumping</a> of solid-state lasers, generating either nanosecond or ultrashort pulses.
In the latter case, the speed of an AOM is sufficient only in the case of a relatively long laser resonator; an <a href="electro_optic_modulators.html" title="electro-optic modulators: optical modulators based on the electro-optic effect">electro-optic modulator</a> may otherwise be required.</li>
<li><a href="active_mode_locking.html" title="active mode locking: a technique of mode locking, based on active modulation of the intracavity losses or the round-trip phase change">Active mode locking</a> is often performed with an AOM for modulating the resonator losses at the round-trip frequency or a multiple thereof.</li>
<li>An AOM can be used as a <a href="pulse_pickers.html" title="pulse pickers: electrically controlled optical switches used for extracting single pulses from a pulse train">pulse picker</a> for reducing the <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="pulse repetition rate: the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a> of a pulse train, e.g. in order to allow for subsequent amplification of pulses to high <a href="pulse_energy.html" title="pulse energy: energy of an optical pulse">pulse energies</a>.</li>
<li>In laser printers and other devices, an AOM can be used for <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="optical modulators: devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">modulating</a> the power of a laser beam.
The modulation may be continuous or digital (on/off).</li>
<li>An AOM can shift the frequency of a laser beam, e.g. in various measurement schemes, or in lasers which are <a href="mode_locking.html" title="mode locking: a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode-locked</a> via frequency-shifted optical feedback.</li>
<li>In some cases one exploits the effect that the diffraction angle depends on the acoustic frequency.
In particular, one can scan the output beam direction (at least in a small range) by changing the modulation frequency.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Important Properties of Acousto-optic Modulators</h2>
<div>
<p>Various aspects can be essential for the selection of an acousto-optic modulator for some application:</p>
<ul>
<li>The material should have a high <em>transparency</em> at the relevant wavelengths, and parasitic reflections should be minimized e.g. with <a href="anti_reflection_coatings.html" title="anti-reflection coatings: optical thin-film coatings for reducing reflections from surfaces">anti-reflection coatings</a>.</li>
<li>In many cases, a high <em>diffraction efficiency</em> is important.
For example, this matters when using the AOM as a <a href="q_switches.html" title="Q switches: optical switches which are typically used for generating nanosecond pulses in lasers">Q switch</a> in a high-<a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> laser, and even more so for <a href="cavity_dumping.html" title="cavity dumping: a method for extracting intense short or ultrashort pulses from a laser, using an optical switch in the laser resonator">cavity dumping</a>.</li>
<li>The required <em>RF power</em> influences both the electric power demands and cooling issues.</li>
<li>The <em>switching time</em> is critical for some applications (e.g. Q switching and particularly <a href="cavity_dumping.html" title="cavity dumping: a method for extracting intense short or ultrashort pulses from a laser, using an optical switch in the laser resonator">cavity dumping</a>).
It is limited by the finite velocity of sound in the acousto-optic medium.
This implies that an AOM switching a laser beam with large diameter is necessarily slow.</li>
<li>For frequency shifters, the device often has to be used in a wide range of RF frequencies.</li>
<li>High optical <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak powers</a> require a suitable material and a large <em>open aperture</em>, allowing for a high <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damage threshold</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to various trade-offs, quite different materials and operation parameters are used in different applications.
For example, the materials with highest diffraction efficiencies are not those with the highest optical damage threshold.
A large mode area can increase the power handling capability, but requires the use of a larger crystal or glass piece and a higher drive power, and also increases the switching time, which is limited by the acoustic transit time.
For fast acousto-optic beam scanners, a large mode area is required for achieving a high pixel resolution, whereas a smaller mode area is required for a high scanning speed.</p>
