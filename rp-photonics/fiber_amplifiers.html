In most cases, the gain medium is a glass fiber <a href="rare_earth_doped_fibers.html" title="rare-earth-doped fibers: optical glass fibers which are doped with rare earth ions">doped with rare earth ions</a> such as <a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="erbium-doped gain media: laser gain media doped with erbium ions">erbium</a> (EDFA = <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers"><em>erbium-doped fiber amplifier</em></a>), <a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="neodymium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium</a>, <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="ytterbium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium</a> (<em>YDFA</em>), praseodymium, or thulium.
This active dopant is <a href="optical_pumping.html" title="optical pumping: electronically exciting a medium with light, or specifically populating certain electronic levels">pumped</a> (provided with energy) with light from a <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>, such as a <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled diode laser</a>; in almost all cases, the pump light propagates through the fiber core together with the signal to be amplified.
A special type of fiber amplifiers are <a href="raman_amplifiers.html" title="Raman amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on Raman gain">Raman amplifiers</a> (see below).</p>
<p>The originally dominating application of fiber amplifiers was in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a> over large distances, where signals need to be periodically amplified.
Typically, one uses <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a> with signals of moderate <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> in the 1.5-&mu;m spectral regions.
Often, many different wavelength channels are simultaneously amplified in a single fiber amplifier (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="wavelength division multiplexing: a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain"><em>wavelength division multiplexing</em></a>).</p>
<p>Other important application areas of fiber amplifiers have been developed later.
In particular, <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber amplifiers</a> have been developed which can produce output powers of hundreds of watts or even many kilowatts.
Such amplifier are now widely used in laser material processing, replacing <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a> and <a href="co2_lasers.html" title="CO<sub>2</sub> lasers: infrared lasers based on a gas mixture in which light is amplified by carbon dioxide molecules">CO<sub>2</sub> lasers</a>, for example.
Typically, they are based on <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="ytterbium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped</a> <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a> for signals in the spectral region of 1.03&ndash;1.1&nbsp;&mu;m.</p>
<p>It is often very convenient (e.g. in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>) that light from a fiber can easily be sent into a fiber amplifier, and the amplified light can be sent into further transmission fiber.
Besides the active (amplifying) fiber, some additional components may be used, e.g. dichroic <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber couplers: fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a> and <a href="faraday_isolators.html" title="Faraday isolators: optical isolators based on the Faraday effect">Faraday isolators</a> (see Figure&nbsp;1).</p>

Two laser diodes (LDs) provide the pump power for the erbium-doped fiber, allowing it to amplify light with wavelength around 1550&nbsp;nm.
Two pig-tailed <a href="faraday_isolators.html" title="Faraday isolators: optical isolators based on the Faraday effect">Faraday isolators</a> strongly reduce the sensitivity of the device to back-reflections.

</figure>
<h2 class="togglediv">Gain and Output Power</h2>
<div>
<p>Due to the possible small mode area and long length of an optical fiber, a high <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> of tens of <a href="decibel.html" title="decibel: a logarithmic measure for power ratios, applied e.g. to optical powers or to noise powers">decibels</a> can be achieved with a moderate pump power, i.e., the <a href="gain_efficiency.html" title="gain efficiency: small-signal gain of an optical amplifier per unit pump power or per unit stored energy">gain efficiency</a> can be very high (particularly for low-power devices).
The gain achievable is often limited by ASE (see below).
The high surface-to-volume ratio and the robust <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode guidance</a> also allow for very high output powers with <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a> <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, particularly when <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a> are used.
However, <a href="high_power_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers.html" title="high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers: fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers with high output powers of e.g. &gt;&thinsp;10&thinsp;&thinsp;W">high-power fiber amplifiers</a> usually have a moderate gain in the final stage, partly due to power efficiency issues; one then uses <a href="amplifier_chains.html" title="amplifier chains: amplifiers consisting of several stages">amplifier chains</a> where the preamplifier provides most of the gain and a final stage the high output power.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Saturation Characteristics</h2>
<div>
<p>In terms of <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="gain saturation: the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">gain saturation</a>, fiber amplifiers are very different from <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="semiconductor optical amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifiers</a> (SOAs).
Due to the small <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="transition cross sections: material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">transition cross sections</a>, the <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="saturation energy: a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation energy</a> is fairly high, e.g. some tens of microjoules for a typical <a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="erbium-doped gain media: laser gain media doped with erbium ions">erbium-doped</a> telecom amplifier, or hundreds of microjoules for a <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area</a> ytterbium-doped amplifier.
As a result, significant energy (sometimes several millijoules) can be stored in a fiber amplifier, and can later be extracted e.g. by a single short <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulse</a>.
Only for output pulse energies above the saturation energy, <a href="nonlinear_pulse_distortion.html" title="nonlinear pulse distortion: distortion of the spatial, temporal or spectral characteristics of an optical pulse, resulting from optical nonlinearities">pulse distortions</a> through saturation become significant.
For amplifying the output of a <a href="mode_locked_lasers.html" title="mode-locked lasers: lasers which emit ultrashort pulses on the basis of the technique of mode locking">mode-locked laser</a>, the gain saturation is normally the same as for a continuous-wave laser with the same average power.</p>
<p>These saturation characteristics are also important for <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, because they prevent any intersymbol interference as can occur with <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="semiconductor optical amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifiers</a>.</p>
<p>Fiber amplifiers are often operated in the strongly saturated regime.
This allows for the highest output power, and the effect of slight variations of pump power on the signal output power is substantially reduced.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">ASE and Noise</h2>
<div>
<p>The gain achievable is often limited not by the available pump power, but by <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="amplified spontaneous emission: a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a> (ASE).
This can become relevant for gains roughly exceeding 40&nbsp;dB.
High-gain amplifiers also need to be protected from any parasitic reflections, because these could lead to <a href="parasitic_lasing.html" title="parasitic lasing: unwanted laser operation in a laser or amplifier device">parasitic laser oscillation</a> or even to <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">fiber damage</a>, and are therefore often equipped with optical isolators at the output and possibly also at the input.</p>
<p>ASE also provides the fundamental limitation of the <a href="amplifier_noise.html" title="amplifier noise: noise introduced to a signal in an amplifier device">amplifier noise</a> properties.
While the excess noise of a loss-less <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="four-level and three-level gain media: laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">four-level amplifier</a> can approach the theoretical limit, corresponding e.g. to a <a href="noise_figure.html" title="noise figure: a measure of the excess noise added in an amplifier">noise figure</a> of 3&nbsp;dB in the case of high gain, the excess noise can be stronger for the usual <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="four-level and three-level gain media: laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level gain media</a> and in the presence of extra losses.
Note that ASE and excess noise are often stronger in backward-pumped amplifiers.</p>
<p>Noise introduced by the pump source may also be an issue.
It can directly affect the gain and thus the signal output power, but not for noise frequencies substantially above the inverse <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="upper-state lifetime: the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a>.
(The laser-active ions represents an energy reservoir which can effectively reduce the effect of fast power fluctuations.)
A variable pump power can also lead to temperature-dependent heating which translates into <a href="phase_noise.html" title="phase noise: noise of the optical phase of a beam or of an electric signal">phase noise</a>.</p>
<p>ASE itself may be utilized for <a href="superluminescent_sources.html" title="superluminescent sources: optical sources based on superluminescence">superluminescent sources</a> with very low temporal <a href="coherence.html" title="coherence: a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a>, as required e.g. for <a href="optical_coherence_tomography.html" title="optical coherence tomography: an optical imaging technique where longitudinal resolution is achieved based on interference effects with low-coherence light">optical coherence tomography</a>.
A superluminescent source has to contain little more than a high-gain fiber amplifier.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Amplifier Modeling</h2>
<div>
<p>It is possible to model (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="laser_modeling.html" title="laser modeling: the investigation of phenomena and quantitative relations in lasers, using theoretical models and computational methods"><em>laser modeling</em></a>) the essential performance aspects of fiber amplifiers in various ways, normally using suitable <a href="fiber_simulation_software.html" title="fiber simulation software: software for numerical simulations on fiber devices">fiber simulation software</a>.
Part of such a model is typically a set of <a href="rate_equation_modeling.html" title="rate equation modeling: a method of modeling the dynamics of laser gain media">rate equations</a>, with which the population densities for given signal and pump intensities can be calculated.
Such a rate equation model may be incorporated in a more comprehensive model which then calculates the optical powers along the fiber.</p>
<p>Applications of amplifier models are manifold.
For example, it is possible to quantify various detrimental effects on the amplifier performance, and use such results for optimizing the fiber parameters or other aspects of the amplifier design.</p>
<p>Although basic properties of a fiber amplifier can be calculated analytically, a full quantitative understanding is normally possible only with numerical simulations.
These can take into account various details such as the <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="four-level and three-level gain media: laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level behavior</a>, strong <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="gain saturation: the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">gain saturation</a> (with optical powers often being far higher than the <a href="saturation_power.html" title="saturation power: a measure of the incident optical power required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation powers</a>), <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="amplified spontaneous emission: a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">amplified spontaneous emission</a> (ASE) due to the high optical <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, and possibly <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="energy transfer: the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfer</a> process for sophisticated situations e.g. with erbium-ytterbium-doped fibers.</p>
<p>Even in simple cases, relatively complex behavior can result.
Figure&nbsp;2 shows an example, where a simple <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="ytterbium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped</a> fiber amplifier is pumped at 940&nbsp;nm.
The decay of pump power in the device is first quite fast, then slower, and finally faster again.
This results from <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="gain saturation: the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">gain saturation</a> by ASE.
Forward ASE is partially reabsorbed before it reaches the right end.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiber_amplifier1.png" alt="ASE in fiber amplifier">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
An ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier with a pump wave input only.
ASE in forward and backward direction keep the ytterbium excitation lower at both ends.
Therefore, the pump absorption varies substantially.
The simulation has been done with the software <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b></a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure&nbsp;3 shows the ASE spectra for the forward and backward direction.
One recognizes that the ASE in the 1030-nm region is quite similar in both directions, whereas strong 975-nm ASE occurs only in backward direction.
That pronounced asymmetry is related to the fact that the right end of the fiber, being only weakly pumped, provides a seed for backward ASE by spontaneous emission, even though the gain at 975&nbsp;nm is substantially negative there.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiber_amplifier2.png" alt="ASE in fiber amplifier">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
Spectra of forward and backward ASE in the fiber amplifier as above.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If we now also inject a 1-mW input signal at 1030&nbsp;nm, gain saturation keeps the ASE at a lower level, and most of the power can be extracted with the signal (see Figure&nbsp;4).</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fiber_amplifier3.png" alt="ASE in fiber amplifier">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span> 
With a 1-mW signal input, ASE is kept down.

</figure>
<p>Even this simple example exhibits various sophisticated details, which can hardly be understood without numerical simulations.
For cases with erbium-ytterbium energy transfers, <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">double-clad fibers</a>, pulsed amplification, etc., this is even more the case.</p>

<div>
<p>Thulium-doped <a href="fluoride_fibers.html" title="fluoride fibers: optical fibers based on fluoride glasses">fluoride fibers</a> (<em>TDFA = thulium-doped amplifier</em>) pumped around 1047 or 1400&nbsp;nm can be used for amplification in the telecom <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">S band</a> around 1460&ndash;1530&nbsp;nm, or even around 1.65&nbsp;&mu;m.
Combined thulium&ndash;erbium amplifiers can thus provide optical amplification in a very wide wavelength range.</p>
<p>There are also thulium-doped amplifiers for the <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">first telecom window</a>, operating at &asymp;&thinsp;800&ndash;850&nbsp;nm.</p>

They can be based on praseodymium-doped fluoride fibers (<em>PDFA = praseodymium-doped amplifier</em>), which are pumped around 1020&nbsp;nm (a relatively inconvenient pump wavelength) or at 1047&nbsp;nm (with a <a href="ylf_lasers.html" title="YLF lasers: lasers based on YLF (yttrium lithium fluoride) crystals, usually Nd:YLF">YLF laser</a>).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Some Design Issues</h2>
<div>
<p>Fiber amplifiers can be pumped in forward direction (i.e. with a pump wave copropagating with the signal wave), in the backward direction, or bidirectionally.
The direction of the pump wave does not influence the small-signal gain, but the power efficiency of the saturated amplifier and also the <a href="amplifier_noise.html" title="amplifier noise: noise introduced to a signal in an amplifier device">noise</a> characteristics.
Bidirectional pumping can be a way not only to apply a high pump power, but also to achieve a low <a href="noise_figure.html" title="noise figure: a measure of the excess noise added in an amplifier">noise figure</a> and a high power efficiency at the same time.</p>
<p>Most fiber amplifiers (e.g. those based on erbium and ytterbium) operate on <a href="four_level_and_three_level_gain_media.html" title="four-level and three-level gain media: laser gain media without/with reabsorption from the lower laser level">quasi-three-level transitions</a> (neodymium-doped amplifiers are a notable exception).
This means that in the unpumped state such amplifiers exhibit some losses caused by the active ions; only when a certain excitation level is exceeded, does actual amplification take place.
The quasi-three-level nature also has implications for <a href="amplifier_noise.html" title="amplifier noise: noise introduced to a signal in an amplifier device">amplifier noise</a>, in particular an increased <a href="noise_figure.html" title="noise figure: a measure of the excess noise added in an amplifier">noise figure</a>, which however can be minimized by certain design optimizations.</p>
<p>Optical <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a> such as the <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="Kerr effect: a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr effect</a> can be significant in fiber amplifiers, particularly for those amplifying <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="ultrafast_amplifiers.html" title="ultrafast amplifiers: amplifiers for ultrashort optical pulses"><em>ultrafast amplifiers</em></a>).
This can lead to strong <a href="self_phase_modulation.html" title="self-phase modulation: nonlinear phase modulation of a beam, caused by its own intensity via the Kerr effect">self-phase modulation</a>, but also to excessive <a href="raman_gain.html" title="Raman gain: optical gain arising from stimulated Raman scattering">Raman gain</a> and thus to the generation of a strong first-order Stokes wave at a wavelength some tens of nanometers longer than that of the amplified signal.
For <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="single-frequency operation: an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency operation</a>, stimulated <a href="brillouin_scattering.html" title="Brillouin scattering: a nonlinear scattering effect involving acoustic phonons">Brillouin scattering</a> is the most important nonlinearity.</p>
<p>The effect of the nonlinearity can be reduced e.g. by increasing the fiber <a href="effective_mode_area.html" title="effective mode area: a quantitative measure of the area which a waveguide or fiber mode effectively covers in the transverse dimensions">mode area</a> (but at the expense of a lower gain efficiency and possibly worse beam quality) or by decreasing the fiber length.
The latter measure becomes possible when using a fiber with higher <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="doping concentration: the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a>, but this can lead to concentration <a href="quenching.html" title="quenching: the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a>.</p>
<p>A technique for radically reducing nonlinear effects is <a href="chirped_pulse_amplification.html" title="chirped-pulse amplification: a technique for amplifying pulses to very high optical intensities while avoiding excessive nonlinear pulse distortions or optical damage">chirped-pulse amplification</a>, where pulses are strongly dispersively stretched before entering the amplifier and subsequently compressed again.
All-fiber setups using that technique (with a <a href="fiber_bragg_gratings.html" title="fiber Bragg gratings: reflective structures in the core of an optical fiber with a periodic or aperiodic perturbation of the effective refractive index">fiber Bragg grating</a> as the compressor) can generate femtosecond pulses only with energies well below 1&nbsp;&mu;J, leading to peak powers in the kilowatt region.
Substantially higher peak powers of the order of 100&nbsp;MW are possible when using bulk-optical elements in addition to a fiber amplifier based on <a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes">large mode area fiber</a>, but some characteristic advantages of fiber-optic systems are lost with that approach.
Compared with fully bulk-optical systems, the use of amplifying fibers has the advantage that sufficient single-pass gain is achievable so that the principle of a <a href="regenerative_amplifiers.html" title="regenerative amplifiers: optical amplifiers with a resonator in which a light pulse can do multiple round trips before being coupled out">regenerative amplifier</a> does not need to be used.</p>
<p>In some cases, a multi-stage amplifier, i.e., an <a href="amplifier_chains.html" title="amplifier chains: amplifiers consisting of several stages">amplifier chain</a>, needs to be realized.
This allows e.g. <a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="amplified spontaneous emission: a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified">ASE</a> suppression with <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">filters</a> or <a href="optical_modulators.html" title="optical modulators: devices allowing one to manipulate properties of light beams, such as the optical power or phase">modulators</a> between the stages, an optimized power efficiency and noise figure, and possibly a modular approach which increases the flexibility for further amplifier developments.</p>
<p>Most fiber amplifiers are not made of <a href="polarization_maintaining_fibers.html" title="polarization-maintaining fibers: specialty optical fibers with strong built-in birefringence, preserving the properly oriented linear polarization of an input beam">polarization-maintaining fibers</a>, so they do not preserve the polarization state of the input.
On the other hand, the amplification process itself is normally not polarization-dependent; this is an advantage over <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="semiconductor optical amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifiers</a> for use in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">telecommunications</a>.
In some cases, however, polarization hole burning can cause problems.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fiber Amplifier Modules</h2>
<div>
<p>Some companies offer fiber amplifier modules which can be convenient for OEM system integrators.
Input and output are then often attached with the usual <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="fiber connectors: connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connectors</a>.
A compact module contains not only the actual fiber amplifier(s), but also the control electronics for the pump diodes, and possibly extras such as an input and/or output <a href="optical_power_monitors.html" title="optical power monitors: devices for monitoring optical powers in free-space light beams or in optical fibers">optical power monitor</a>, power stabilization, alarms, <a href="gain_equalization.html" title="gain equalization: a technique for making the gain spectrum of an optical amplifier device flatter over a certain optical frequency range">gain-flattening filters</a>, etc.
Such amplifier modules are available based on <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped</a> fibers, ytterbium-doped fibers, and others, and for various power levels.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Raman Fiber Amplifiers</h2>

<p>Raman amplifiers are based not on a laser amplification process, but on <a href="raman_scattering.html" title="Raman scattering: a nonlinear scattering process involving optical phonons">Raman scattering</a> in a fiber.

<h2>The Transparent Laser</h2>
<p>The dream of each laser developer, and not only of each laser scientist: have a <b>transparent laser</b>, where you can <b>look into any components</b> and see e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>optical intensities</li>
<li>excitation densities of laser-active ions</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and this at any location and time, with arbitrary resolution!</p>
<p>If you had this, finally you could</p>
<ul>
<li>fully understand what goes on in your laser,</li>
<li>quickly identify and fix any problems, and</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">make faster progress <br> while saving a lot of money.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely marvelous, but only a dream?!?</p>
<p>Good news: such transparent lasers can be made!
