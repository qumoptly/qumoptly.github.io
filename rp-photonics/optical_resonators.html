<p>An optical resonator (or resonant optical <a href="cavities.html" title="cavities: resonators for light (or for microwaves)">cavity</a>) is an arrangement of optical components which allows a <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">beam</a> of light to circulate in a closed path.
Such resonators can be made in very different forms.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Resonators with Bulk Components Versus Waveguide Resonators</h2>
<div>
<p>An optical resonator can be made from bulk optical components, as shown in Figure&nbsp;1, or as a <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a> resonator, where the light is guided rather than sent through free space.</p>
<p>Bulk-optical resonators are used for <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a>, for example.
Their transverse mode properties depend on the overall setup (including the length of air spaces), and mode sizes can vary significantly along the resonator.
In some cases, the mode properties are also significantly influenced by effects such as <a href="thermal_lensing.html" title="thermal lensing: a lensing effect induced by temperature gradients">thermal lensing</a>.</p>
<p>Waveguide resonators are often made with optical <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> (e.g. for <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>) or in the form of <a href="integrated_optics.html" title="integrated optics: the technology dealing with the construction of photonic integrated circuits">integrated optics</a>.
The transverse <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">mode</a> properties (see below) are determined by the local properties of the waveguide.</p>
<p>There are also mixed types of resonators, containing both waveguides and parts with free-space optical propagation.
Such resonators are used e.g. in some <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber lasers</a>, where bulk-optical components need to be inserted into the <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Linear Resonators Versus Ring Resonators</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:165px;">
<img src="img/linear_and_ring_resonator.png" alt="linear resonator and ring resonator">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A simple linear optical resonator with a curved folding mirror (top) and a four-mirror bow-tie ring resonator (bottom).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Linear (or standing-wave) resonators</em> (Figure&nbsp;1, top) are made such that the light bounces back and forth between two end mirrors.
For continuously circulating light, there are always counterpropagating waves, which <a href="interference.html" title="interference: a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interfere</a> with each other to form a standing-wave pattern.</p>
<p>In <em>ring resonators</em> (Figure&nbsp;1, bottom), light can circulate in two different directions (see also: <a href="ring_lasers.html" title="ring lasers: lasers with a ring resonator"><em>ring lasers</em></a>).
A ring resonator has no end mirrors.</p>
<p>In either case, a resonator may contain additional optical elements which are passed in each round trip.
For example, a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> contains a <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> which can compensate the resonator losses in each round trip of the light.</p>
<p>During a resonator round trip, light experiences various physical effects which change its spatial distribution: diffraction, focusing or defocusing effects of optical elements (sometimes involving optical <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>), in special cases also <a href="gain_guiding.html" title="gain guiding: guiding of light based on spatially inhomogeneous optical gain">gain guiding</a>, <a href="saturable_absorbers.html" title="saturable absorbers: light absorbers with a degree of absorption which is reduced at high optical intensities">saturable absorption</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Some important differences between linear resonators and ring resonators are:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a ring resonator, light can circulate in two different directions.
If there is an <a href="output_couplers.html" title="output couplers: partially transparent laser mirrors, used for extracting output beams from laser resonators">output coupler</a> mirror, this leads to two different output beams.
A linear resonator with the output coupler at an end does not exhibit this phenomenon.</li>
<li>An optical component within a resonator is hit by the light once per round trip in the case of a ring laser, and twice per round trip in a linear resonator (except for the end mirrors).</li>
<li>When light is injected into a linear resonator via a partially transparent mirror, reflected light can propagate back to the light source.
This is not the case for a ring resonator.
Therefore, ring resonators are sometimes preferred for <a href="resonant_frequency_doubling.html" title="resonant frequency doubling: frequency doubling with a nonlinear crystal placed in a resonant enhancement cavity">resonant frequency doubling</a> with a laser source which is sensitive against optical feedback.</li>
<li>A linear bulk resonator can have two <a href="stability_zones.html" title="stability zones: parameter regions of an optical resonator where the resonator is geometrically stable">stability zones</a> (see below), e.g. for variation of the dioptric power of an internal <a href="lenses.html" title="lenses: transparent optical devices affecting the wavefront curvature of light">lens</a>, or of a resonator arm length.
A ring resonator has only one stability zone.
(If the internal lens is passed more than once per round trip in the ring resonator, or more than twice in the linear resonator, there can be more stability zones.)</li>
<li>The non-normal incidence of light on every resonator mirror of a ring resonator causes astigmatism if a resonator mirror has a curved surface.
A bow-tie ring resonator geometry is often used to minimize astigmatism by keeping the incidence angles small.</li>
<li>Monolithic ring resonators with high <a href="q_factor.html" title="<i>Q</i> factor: a measure of the damping of resonator modes"><i>Q</i> factor</a> can exploit <a href="total_internal_reflection.html" title="total internal reflection: the phenomenon that light incident on the boundary between two transparent media is fully reflected if the light is coming from the optical more dense medium and the angle of incidence is sufficiently large">total internal reflection</a> at all surfaces, and thus may not require any <a href="dielectric_mirrors.html" title="dielectric mirrors: mirrors consisting of multiple thin layers of different transparent optical materials">dielectric mirror</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Stable Versus Unstable Bulk-optical Resonators</h2>
<div>
<p>Stability of a bulk-optical resonator essentially means that any ray injected into the system with some initial transverse offset position and angle will stay within the system during many round trips.
For <a href="unstable_resonators.html" title="unstable resonators: optical resonators which are dynamically unstable with respect to transverse beam offsets">unstable resonators</a>, there are rays which exhibit an unlimited increase in transverse offset, so that they will leave the optical system.</p>
<p>The stability of a resonator depends on the properties and arrangement of the optical components, basically the curvature of reflecting surfaces, other focusing effects, and the distances between the components.
When a parameter such as an arm length or the dioptric power of focusing element in the resonator is varied, the resonator may go through one (for ring resonators) or two (for standing-wave resonators) <a href="stability_zones.html" title="stability zones: parameter regions of an optical resonator where the resonator is geometrically stable">stability zones</a> [2].
At the edges of such stability zones, the beam sizes at the resonator ends can diverge or go toward zero, and the <a href="alignment_sensitivity.html" title="alignment sensitivity: the sensitivity of a laser, an optical resonator or some other device with respect to misalignment">alignment sensitivity</a> may also diverge.</p>
<p>Most <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state</a> <a href="bulk_lasers.html" title="bulk lasers: lasers based on bulk crystals as gain media">bulk lasers</a> are based on stable resonators, but <a href="unstable_resonators.html" title="unstable resonators: optical resonators which are dynamically unstable with respect to transverse beam offsets">unstable resonators</a> have advantages in certain lasers, particularly those with very <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="high-power lasers: lasers emitting very high optical powers">high output power</a> and high laser <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>, where a better <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> may be achieved.
The modes of unstable resonators have rather complicated properties.
Output coupling is often done with a highly reflecting mirror where part of the circulating light is lost around the edges (or possibly only on one side).
Another possibility is to use a partially transmissive <a href="output_couplers.html" title="output couplers: partially transparent laser mirrors, used for extracting output beams from laser resonators">output coupler</a> mirror with a transverse variation of reflectivity (<em>Gaussian reflectivity mirrors</em>).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Resonator Modes</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="resonator_modes.html" title="resonator modes: modes of an optical or microwave resonator">Resonator modes</a> are essentially self-consistent field distributions of light &ndash; more precisely, electric field distributions which are self-reproducing (apart from a possible loss of power) in each resonator round trip.</p>
<p>The properties of resonator modes depend very much on various details:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <em>waveguide resonators</em>, the transverse mode structure is determined by the waveguide properties only, and is constant everywhere in the resonator, if the waveguide properties are constant.
Only a single transverse mode shape may exist, e.g. if <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a> are used.</li>
<li>In <em>bulk-optical resonators</em>, the mode properties depend on the overall optical setup, and differ very much between stable and unstable resonators (see above).
For stable resonators, the transverse mode patterns can be described e.g. with <a href="hermite_gaussian_modes.html" title="Hermite&ndash;Gaussian modes: propagation modes or resonator modes which are described with Hermite&ndash;Gaussian functions">Hermite&ndash;Gaussian</a> functions.
The lowest-order mode (axial mode, fundamental mode) has the simplest profile; more complicated shapes correspond to <a href="higher_order_modes.html" title="higher-order modes: transverse modes of a resonator or waveguide, excluding the fundamental (axial) modes">higher-order modes</a>.
The mode properties can be calculated using an <a href="abcd_matrix.html" title="ABCD matrix: a 2-by-2 matrix describing the effect of an optical element on a laser beam">ABCD matrix</a> algorithm.
Unstable resonators exhibit a much more complicated mode structure, which can be calculated only with numerical means.
Generally, the transverse mode size varies along the resonator axis.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the transverse mode patterns, there are only certain <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="optical frequency: the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequencies</a> for which the <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">optical phase</a> is self-consistently reproduced after each round trip (i.e. the round-trip phase shift is an integer multiple of 2<span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&pi;</span></span>).
These are called the <em>mode frequencies</em> or <em>resonance frequencies</em> and are approximately equidistant (but not exactly equidistant due to <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>).
The frequency spacing of the resonator modes, also called <a href="free_spectral_range.html" title="free spectral range: frequency spacing of the axial modes of an optical resonator"><em>free spectral range</em></a> (FSR), is the inverse round-trip time, or more precisely the inverse round-trip <a href="group_delay.html" title="group delay: a measure of the time delay experienced by narrow-band light pulses in an optical device">group delay</a>.
This means that the FSR becomes smaller as the resonator length is increased.
The ratio of the frequency spacing to the width of the resonances (resonator <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a>) is called the <a href="finesse.html" title="finesse: the free spectral range divided by the FWHM width of the resonances of an optical resonator"><em>finesse</em></a> and is determined by the power losses per resonator round trip.
A related measure is the <a href="q_factor.html" title="<i>Q</i> factor: a measure of the damping of resonator modes"><i>Q</i> factor</a>, which is the ratio of resonance frequency and bandwidth.</p>
<p>The article on <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="resonator modes: modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a> gives more details.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Resonant Enhancement</h2>
<div>
<p>If e.g. an end mirror is partially transparent, light can be fed into the resonator from outside.
The highest internal <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> (and the maximum transmission through a resonator) can be achieved when the (monochromatic) input light has a frequency matching that of one of the modes, and the spatial shapes are also matched (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="mode_matching.html" title="mode matching: the precise spatial matching of the electric field distributions of laser beams and resonator modes or waveguide modes"><em>mode matching</em></a>).
Particularly for low-loss resonators, the circulating intracavity power can then greatly exceed the input power by means of <em>resonant enhancement</em> (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="enhancement_cavities.html" title="enhancement cavities: optical cavities for exploiting the resonant enhancement of the power of circulating light"><em>enhancement cavities</em></a>).</p>
<p>Resonant enhancement is also possible for a regular train of light <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a>, when the frequencies of the pulse train match the optical resonances.
In the time domain, this means that the pulse period matches the resonator's round-trip time, or an integer fraction of it.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Subtle Properties of Bulk-optical Resonators</h2>
<div>
<p>The physics of bulk-optical resonators is surprisingly rich in nature.
Some interesting aspects are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The modes of a resonator with a transverse variation of optical gain or loss in general do not form an orthogonal set of functions.
These non-normal modes have some peculiar properties.
For example, the total power in a superposition of such modes is <em>not</em> simply the sum of the power in the different modes.
Under some conditions, resonators with nonnormal modes can be treated with complex Gaussian beam analysis, where e.g. the elements of the <a href="abcd_matrix.html" title="ABCD matrix: a 2-by-2 matrix describing the effect of an optical element on a laser beam">ABCD matrix</a> and the Gaussian <a href="beam_radius.html" title="beam radius: a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> can be complex numbers.</li>
<li>In situations with general astigmatism (such as in some nonplanar <a href="ring_lasers.html" title="ring lasers: lasers with a ring resonator">ring laser</a> resonators), there are interesting effects such as image rotation, polarization rotation, and so-called <em>twisted beams</em>.</li>
<li>There are technically interesting methods (often of numerical nature) for <a href="resonator_design.html" title="resonator design: the description of the optical components from which an optical resonator is made, and their exact arrangement">designing a resonator</a> with given properties.</li>
<li>The design of a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> has important influences on various aspects of laser operation, e.g. on the <a href="alignment_sensitivity.html" title="alignment sensitivity: the sensitivity of a laser, an optical resonator or some other device with respect to misalignment">alignment sensitivity</a> and the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Application of Optical Resonators</h2>
<div>
<p>Optical resonators are used for, e.g., the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>as <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers"><em>laser resonators</em></a>, where the resonator losses are compensated by a <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> to maintain or build up optical power</li>

<li>for filtering the transverse shape of optical radiation (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="mode_cleaner_cavities.html" title="mode cleaner cavities: optical cavities used as filters for improving the beam quality of laser beams"><em>mode cleaner cavities</em></a>)</li>
<li>as short-term <a href="optical_frequency_standards.html" title="optical frequency standards: frequency standards using optical transitions in atoms, ions or molecules"><em>optical frequency standards</em></a> (when e.g. the frequency of a laser is locked to a resonance frequency of a stable <a href="reference_cavities.html" title="reference cavities: optical cavities serving as a kind of frequency reference">reference cavity</a>)</li>
<li>for precise length measurements, e.g. exploiting the periodically occurring resonances when the resonator length is changed</li>
<li>for exploiting the resonant enhancement of intracavity power (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="enhancement_cavities.html" title="enhancement cavities: optical cavities for exploiting the resonant enhancement of the power of circulating light"><em>enhancement cavities</em></a>), e.g. in order to achieve efficient <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="frequency doubling: the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doubling</a> of light from a low-power <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="single-frequency operation: an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency</a> laser</li>
