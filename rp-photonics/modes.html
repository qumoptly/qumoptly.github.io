<p>This articles discusses propagation modes of light in free space, in a transparent homogeneous medium, in a waveguide structure, or in an optical resonator.
Alternatively, the term &ldquo;mode&rdquo; can also mean a mode operation], e.g. continuous-wave <a href="mode_locking.html" title="mode locking: a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode locking</a>, <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a>, or <a href="single_frequency_operation.html" title="single-frequency operation: an operation mode of a laser where only a single resonator mode acquires a significant power">single-frequency operation</a>; for such information, see the article on <a href="modes_of_laser_operation.html" title="modes of laser operation: a mode of operation such as continuous-wave operation, Q-switched or mode-locked operation">modes of laser operation</a>.</p>
<p>When some light beam propagates in free space or in a transparent medium, its transverse intensity profile generally changes during propagation (see Figure&nbsp;1).
There are, however, certain electric field distributions which are self-consistent during propagation; these are called <em>modes</em>.
What &ldquo;self-consistent&rdquo; means in the mentioned definition, depends on the situation.
Different situations are discussed in the following sections.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/beam_evolution.png" alt="evolution of a beam intensity profile">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Simulated evolution of the intensity profile of a laser beam. The shape of the profile changes during propagation. This would not be the case for a mode.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 class="togglediv">Free-space Modes</h2>
<div>
<p>The mathematically simplest kinds of modes in free space (or in an optically homogeneous medium) are <em>plane waves</em>.
A plane wave satisfies the wave equation, provided only that the wavelength times the <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="optical frequency: the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a> matches the <a href="phase_velocity.html" title="phase velocity: the velocity with which phase fronts propagate in a medium">phase velocity</a> of light in the medium.
During propagation in a direction, a plane wave only changes its oscillation <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a>, and possibly its amplitude if there is optical loss or <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> in a medium.</p>
<p>Although plane waves are mathematically very simple, they cannot resemble any wave occurring in reality, since they have an infinite transverse extent.
Therefore, other kinds of modes, which are limited in the transverse spatial dimension, are often of higher interest.
The simplest kind of such modes are <em>Gaussian modes</em>.
A <a href="gaussian_beams.html" title="Gaussian beams: light beams where the electric field profile in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis can be described with a Gaussian function, possibly with an added parabolic phase profile">Gaussian beam</a> expands or contracts during propagation, but is self-consistent in the sense that the amplitude profile is only scaled in the transverse dimension, but has a constant (in that case Gaussian) shape.</p>
<p>Each Gaussian mode is only the simplest member of a whole family of modes, which contains an infinite number of modes.
The most frequently used mode families (mode systems) are those of <a href="hermite_gaussian_modes.html" title="Hermite&ndash;Gaussian modes: propagation modes or resonator modes which are described with Hermite&ndash;Gaussian functions"><em>Hermite&ndash;Gaussian modes</em></a> and <em>Laguerre&ndash;Gaussian modes</em>.
Within such a mode family, the Gaussian mode is the <em>fundamental mode</em>, while all other modes are called <a href="higher_order_modes.html" title="higher-order modes: transverse modes of a resonator or waveguide, excluding the fundamental (axial) modes"><em>higher-order modes</em></a> and have more complicated intensity profiles (see Figure&nbsp;2).
During propagation, the transverse extent of each higher-order mode changes in proportion to that of the fundamental mode.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/tem_modes.png" alt="intensity distributions of TEM modes">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Intensity profiles of the lowest-order <a href="hermite_gaussian_modes.html" title="Hermite&ndash;Gaussian modes: propagation modes or resonator modes which are described with Hermite&ndash;Gaussian functions">Hermite&ndash;Gaussian modes</a>, starting with TEM<sub>00</sub> (lower left-hand side) and going up to TEM<sub>33</sub> (upper right-hand side).
The two mode indices indicate the number of zero crossings of the intensity distributions in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that for each combination of an optical frequency, a beam axis, a focus position, and some <a href="beam_radius.html" title="beam radius: a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> of the Gaussian mode in the focus, a whole family e.g. of Hermite&ndash;Gaussian modes arises.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Waveguide Modes</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">Waveguide</a> structures are spatially inhomogeneous structures which can guide waves.
For light propagating in a waveguide, the self-consistency condition for a mode is more strict than for free-space modes: the shape of the complex amplitude profile in the transverse dimensions must remain exactly constant.
Any re-scaling is not allowed, only an overall phase change and a loss or gain of total <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a>, which are both described by the <a href="propagation_constant.html" title="propagation constant: a mode- and frequency-dependent quantity describing the propagation of light in a medium or waveguide"><em>propagation constant</em></a>.</p>
<p>A waveguide has only a finite number of <em>guided propagation modes</em>, the intensity distributions of which have a finite extent around the waveguide core.
The number of guided modes, their transverse amplitude profiles and their propagation constants depend on the details of the waveguide structure and on the optical frequency.
A single-mode waveguide (e.g. a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>) has only a single guided mode per polarization direction.
As an example of a multimode waveguide, Figure&nbsp;3 shows the transverse profiles of all the <a href="lp_modes.html" title="LP modes: linearly polarized modes of optical fibers with radially symmetric index profiles in the approximation of weak guidance">LP modes</a> of a <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fiber</a>.</p>

The two colors indicate different signs of electric field values.

</figure>
<p>A waveguide also has <em>cladding modes</em>, the intensity distributions of which essentially fill the whole cladding (and core) region.
Optical fibers (even <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a>) have a large number of cladding modes, which often exhibit substantial propagation losses at the outer interface of the cladding.</p>
<p>Optical <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> (except for <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="photonic crystal fibers: specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a>) usually have a radially symmetric refractive index profile and also a relatively small refractive index contrast between core and cladding.
In that case, one can quite accurately describes the mode as <a href="lp_modes.html" title="LP modes: linearly polarized modes of optical fibers with radially symmetric index profiles in the approximation of weak guidance">LP modes</a>, which are mathematically simpler to describe and are therefore usually used in practice.</p>
<p>For radially symmetric refractive index profiles, there is also the interesting phenomenon of <em>orbital angular momentum modes</em> [5,&thinsp;6].
Those carry an angular momentum which is <em>not</em> related to the photon spin, also not to a rotating <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">polarization</a> direction.
The wavefronts exhibit a helical structure.
This is possible only for modes having zero intensity at the beam center &ndash; for example, <a href="lp_modes.html" title="LP modes: linearly polarized modes of optical fibers with radially symmetric index profiles in the approximation of weak guidance">LP modes</a> with non-zero <span class="eqn_il"><i>l</i></span>.</p>
<p>Modes of fiber and other waveguides can be numerically calculated numerically with so-called <em>mode solvers</em>, which can be part of a <a href="fiber_simulation_software.html" title="fiber simulation software: software for numerical simulations on fiber devices">fiber simulation software</a>.
Depending on whether the waveguides have radially symmetric profiles and are weakly guiding, mode solver algorithms with a different level of complexity and quite different computation times are required.
A mode solver for optical fibers, when restricted to pure <a href="lp_modes.html" title="LP modes: linearly polarized modes of optical fibers with radially symmetric index profiles in the approximation of weak guidance">LP modes</a>, can be numerically much simpler and faster than a general 2D mode solver.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Resonator Modes</h2>
<div>
<p>For light in <a href="optical_resonators.html" title="optical resonators: arrangements of optical components which allow a beam of light to circulate">optical resonators</a> (made of bulk-optical elements, not with <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a>), the self-consistency condition for a mode is again different: a mode must reproduce its exact transverse amplitude profile (without any re-scaling) only after a full resonator round trip; during the round trip, the mode profile may change in size and even in shape.
On the other hand, the <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">optical phase</a> must also be reproduced after one round trip, i.e., the total experienced phase change must be an integer multiple of <span class="eqn_il">2<span class="greek">&pi;</span></span>.
The overall optical power may decrease or increase if there are optical losses or <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> in the resonator.</p>
<p>Due to the phase condition, <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="resonator modes: modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a> can exist only for certain optical frequencies (the resonance frequencies).
In general, the round-trip phase shift depends on the intensity pattern of a mode.
Therefore, different higher-order modes can have different sets of mode frequencies.
In the simpler case of a geometrically stable resonator, there are fundamental (axial) modes with Gaussian shape and higher-order transverse modes e.g. of <a href="hermite_gaussian_modes.html" title="Hermite&ndash;Gaussian modes: propagation modes or resonator modes which are described with Hermite&ndash;Gaussian functions">Hermite&ndash;Gaussian</a> shape.
Unstable resonators also have modes, but with much more complicated mode properties.</p>
<p>The article on <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="resonator modes: modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a> gives more details.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Application of the Mode Concept</h2>
<div>
<p>In many photonic devices, light propagates only in a single mode.
For example, <a href="single_mode_operation.html" title="single-mode operation: operation of a laser on axial (longitudinal) resonator modes only, or even on a single axial mode">single-mode operation</a> of a <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> means that only a single mode of its <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> is excited (i.e., carries a significant optical power).
If the lasing mode is a Gaussian mode, the output is close to <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a>, i.e. it has an ideal <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
As another example, a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a> guarantees a fixed intensity profile at its output, assuming that all light launched into cladding modes (unguided modes) is lost before the fiber end is reached.
The mode of a single-mode fiber normally has a shape which is similar to that of a Gaussian.</p>
<p>In other cases, it is often convenient to decompose all the propagating light into different modes.
That decomposition means that for each mode some <em>mode amplitude</em> (a complex number) is calculated for the given light field, usually using some overlap integral.
The basic advantage of such a procedure is that it is known how all the modes propagate: for each mode, there is only a phase change which can be calculated from the <a href="propagation_constant.html" title="propagation constant: a mode- and frequency-dependent quantity describing the propagation of light in a medium or waveguide">propagation constant</a>, and possibly some change in optical power.
The total intensity and phase profile can then be calculated for any position simply by adding up the contributions of different modes.
This procedure can greatly simplify numerical simulations: a large number of amplitudes, resembling e.g. a two-dimensional optical field distribution with many samples on a fine grid, can be replaced with a relatively small number of mode amplitudes (excitation coefficients), and thus often strongly reduce the demands both in terms of required computer memory and computation time.</p>
<p>The mode concept is useful even if the propagation conditions somewhat deviate from those for which the modes have been calculated.
In such cases, <a href="mode_coupling.html" title="mode coupling: a concept for describing and calculating light propagation in certain situations, e.g. involving nonlinear interactions">mode coupling</a> can occur: light from some mode can be coupled to one or several other modes.
This is usually described with coupled differential equations for the mode amplitudes.
Such mode coupling can be caused, e.g., by <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinear interactions</a> at high optical intensities or by external disturbances which act on a waveguide.</p>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="spotlight_2009_10_1930d7.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
