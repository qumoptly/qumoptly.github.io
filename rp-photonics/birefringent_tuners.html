<p>A birefringent tuner is an <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">optical filter</a> device used in a <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonator</a> for <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">tuning</a> of the output wavelength and/or for narrowing the optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> (<a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a>).
There are different tuner designs (see below), all exploiting the <a href="birefringence.html" title="birefringence: the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a> of some optically anisotropic crystalline plates.
A <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> containing such a filter will typically operate at a wavelength near a point with minimum transmission loss, if the filter curve is sufficiently sharp.
The wavelength of minimum loss can be shifted by modifying the tilt angle of the birefringent filter.
A mount with a micrometer screw allows for precise adjustments.</p>
<p>Birefringent tuners are often used in <a href="vibronic_lasers.html" title="vibronic lasers: lasers based on gain media with a large gain bandwidth, caused by a strong interaction of electronic transitions with phonons">vibronic lasers</a>, such as <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers: lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers</a>, in <a href="dye_lasers.html" title="dye lasers: lasers based on liquid or solid dyes as gain media">dye lasers</a>, and sometimes in <a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="optical parametric oscillators: coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">optical parametric oscillators</a>.
They make it possible to tune the output wavelength over hundreds of nanometers while introducing only small losses into the laser resonator.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Single-plate Tuners</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:207px;">
<img src="img/single_plate_tuner.png" alt="single-plate birefringent tuner">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Setup of a single-plate birefringent tuner. By rotating the plate around the dashed axis, the transmission wavelengths can be tuned.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The simplest kind of birefringent tuner has a single birefringent plate (e.g. of crystalline quartz), through which the intracavity <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> propagates.
Usually, it is inserted with an angle of incidence near Brewster's angle in order to minimize reflection losses for p polarization.
The birefringence leads to wavelength-dependent polarization changes and thus transmission losses, arising from the Fresnel reflection of s-polarized light at the surfaces or at an additional <a href="polarizers.html" title="polarizers: optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizer</a>.
The induced losses vary approximately sinusoidally with the wavelength.
The thicker the birefringent plate, the smaller is the <a href="free_spectral_range.html" title="free spectral range: frequency spacing of the axial modes of an optical resonator">free spectral range</a>.</p>
<p>As the ordinary and extraordinary components have slightly different propagation directions within the plate (there is <em>double refraction</em>!), the corresponding contributions to the output beam do not perfectly overlap.
That effect is usually hardly relevant unless the <a href="beam_radius.html" title="beam radius: a measure of the transverse extension of a light beam">beam radius</a> is rather small.</p>
<aside class="callout green">How to calculate the transmission spectra?</aside>
<p>The mathematical analysis of the transmission properties is not trivial.
First, one needs to use <a href="fresnel_equations.html" title="Fresnel equations: equations for the amplitude coefficients of transmission and reflection at the interface between two transparent homogeneous media">Fresnel equations</a> for the amplitude transmission factors for s and p polarization.
Then, one needs to calculate the complex amplitudes for ordinary and extraordinary polarization, taking into account that the optical axis can be rotated with an arbitrary angle against the plane of incidence.
(Sometimes, one uses plates where the optical axis is not parallel to the plate surface, but has some angle against it.)
Further, one needs to apply the <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">phase</a> shifts experienced by the ordinary and extraordinary wave; their difference is what essentially causes the wavelength dependence of the transmission.
Finally, the amplitudes for s and p polarization just before the output surface need to be calculated, and after application of the Fresnel factors, one finally obtains the output amplitudes for s and p polarization.
Unfortunately, the scientific literature contains various errors in the corresponding equations.
Note also that there are simplified equations delivering only approximate results, and the limits of validity are often not obvious.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/birefringent_tuner1.png" alt="transmission spectrum">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Transmission spectrum of a single-plate birefringent tuner, made of a 2&nbsp;mm thick &alpha;-quartz plate. The plate is oriented at Brewster's angle, and its optical axis is rotated by 40&deg; against the plane of incidence, where the optimum transmission contrast is achieved. By adding a linear polarizer, which transmits only light with p polarization, one would obtain the blue curve.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By rotating the plate around an axis which is perpendicular to the plate surface, one can shift the transmission curve.
As the angle of incidence is not changed, the low-loss condition for p-polarized light at Brewster's angle is not lost by the rotation.
The lateral position of the output beam is hardly affected; it is only that ordinary and extraordinary components have slightly different propagation directions within the plate, and the direction of the extraordinary component changes somewhat by the rotation since it depends on the angle between k vector and optical axis.
Note, however, that the transmission contrast is reduced for angles substantially deviating from the optimum angle, for which the effective birefringence is strongest &ndash; see Figure&nbsp;3.
That optimum rotation angle of the plate is &approx;40&deg; in the example case; at that point, the angle between <span class="eqn_il"><i>k</i></span> vector and principle plane becomes 45&deg;.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;3:</span> 
Transmission spectra of a 2&nbsp;mm thick single-plate birefringent tuner for different orientations of the plate concerning its optical axis.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For relatively thick plates as in the situation of Figure&nbsp;3, high transmission contrast is maintained for tuning over several free spectral ranges; that is no more the case for substantially thinner plates.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Multi-plate Tuners</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:230px;">
<img src="img/3-plate_tuner.png" alt="multi-crystal birefringent tuner">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;4:</span> 
Setup of a 3-plate birefringent tuner.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A sharper filter response can in principle be obtained simply by using a thicker birefringent plate.
However, this causes the transmission minima to be closer in wavelength (i.e., one obtains a reduced <a href="free_spectral_range.html" title="free spectral range: frequency spacing of the axial modes of an optical resonator">free spectral range</a>), so that the laser may not operate at the desired loss minimum.
That problem can be solved by using multiple birefringent plates with different thickness [2] (<em>multi-crystal birefringent filters</em>).
A typical air-spaced filter stack contains 2&ndash;4 plates.
Figure&nbsp;4 shows an example for a 3-plate tuner.
Note that the plates can be mounted such that the whole arrangement can be rotated together around an axis which is perpendicular to the plates.
Figure&nbsp;5 shows an example for a transmission curve.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/birefringent_tuner3.png" alt="single-plate birefringent tuner">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;5:</span> 
Transmission spectrum of a 3-plate birefringent tuner with plate thicknesses of 2&nbsp;mm, 6&nbsp;mm and 20&nbsp;mm.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The optical losses for unwanted wavelengths can be increased by inserting polarizers between the different plates.
With additional constraints on the plate thickness values, this leads to the design of a <a href="lyot_filters.html" title="Lyot filters: optical filter devices based on birefringence, exhibiting a wavelength-dependent transmission">Lyot filter</a>, showing strong suppression of light with wavelengths between the transmission peaks.
However, the losses via Fresnel reflections, and possibly also the polarization dependence of optical <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> in the <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a>, are usually sufficient for wavelength tuning, so that additional polarizers are not required.
A kind of intermediate solution is that of a <em>Solc filter</em>, where polarizers are located only outside the stack of birefringent plates, but not between them.</p>
<p>The analysis and optimization of birefringent filters is a quite sophisticated matter.
The Jones matrices for the different plates can be calculated as outlined above and multiplied to obtain the total Jones matrix.
The thickness values of the different plates in the range of rotation angles can be optimized with respect to various criteria, depending on the application &ndash; for example, for particularly narrow transmission peaks or for keeping secondary peaks as low as possible.
Also, it can be advantageous to use plates with some angle between optical axis and the plate surface, but such plates are more difficult to make and therefore more difficult to procure and more expensive.
Tolerances for the parts also need to be considered; particularly the thickness values for multi-plate tuners need to be quite precise.
Note that when the plates are rigidly assembled together (as usual) and can be rotated only together, there is no possibility to compensate thickness deviations of single plates via orientation angles.</p>
<p>Another interesting and somewhat complicated aspect comes into play when a birefringent tuner is used within a laser resonator which does not contain a <a href="polarizers.html" title="polarizers: optical filters where the light transmission depends strongly on the direction of polarization">polarizer</a>.
One can then not assume that the input light to the birefringent filter is linearly polarized.
Instead, one needs to calculate the eigenpolarization states of the resonator and their losses.
The resulting effective transmission curves generally look quite different from those obtained for single-pass situations, although the transmission peaks occur for the same wavelengths.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, various scientific publications on birefringent tuners contain substantial errors.
Partly, such errors have led to wrong conclusions concerning the optimization of filter designs.
Ref. [7] appears to be a useful and reliable review paper, correcting various mistakes.</p>
