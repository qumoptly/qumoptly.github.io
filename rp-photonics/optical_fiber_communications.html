<p>Optical <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> can be used to transmit light and thus information over long distances.
Fiber-based systems have largely replaced radio transmitter systems for long-haul <a href="optical_data_transmission.html" title="optical data transmission: the transmission of information using light beams, e.g. in fibers">optical data transmission</a>.
They are widely used for telephony, but also for Internet traffic, long high-speed local area networks (LANs), cable TV (CATV), and increasingly also for shorter distances within buildings.
In most cases, <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a> are used, except for very short distances, where plastic optical fibers can be advantageous.</p>
<p>Compared with systems based on electrical cables, the approach of optical fiber communications (<em>lightwave communications</em>) has advantages, the most important of which are:</p>
<aside class="callout blue">See also our useful tutorial &quot;<a href="passive_fiber_optics.html"><b>Passive Fiber Optics</b></a>&quot;! This explains many aspects of fiber optics using interesting simulations.</aside>
<ul>
<li>The capacity of fibers for data transmission is huge: a single <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fiber</a> can carry hundreds of thousands of telephone channels, utilizing only a small part of the theoretical capacity. In the last 30&nbsp;years, the progress concerning transmission capacities of fiber links has been significantly faster than e.g. the progress in the speed or storage capacity of computers.</li>
<li>The losses for light propagating in fibers are amazingly small: &asymp;&thinsp;0.2&nbsp;dB/km for modern <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode</a> silica fibers, so that many tens of kilometers can be bridged without <a href="amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers: devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifying</a> the signals.</li>
<li>A large number of channels can be reamplified in a single <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a>, if required for very large transmission distances.</li>
<li>Due to the huge transmission rate achievable, the cost per transported bit can be extremely low.</li>
<li>Compared with electrical cables, <a href="fiber_cables.html" title="fiber cables: cables containing one or several optical fibers">fiber-optic cables</a> are very lightweight.</li>
<li>Fiber-optic cables are immune to problems that arise with electrical cables, such as ground loops or electromagnetic interference (EMI).
Such issues are important, for example, for data links in industrial environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly due to their very high data transmission capacity, fiber-optic transmission systems can achieve a much lower cost than systems based on coaxial copper cables, if high data rates are needed.
For low data rates, where their full transmission capacity cannot be utilized, fiber-optic systems may have less of an economic advantage, or may even be more expensive (not due to the fibers, but the additional transceivers).
The primary reason, however, for the still widespread use of copper cables for the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; (the connection to the homes and offices) is simply that copper cables are already laid out, whereas new digging operations would be required to lay down additional fiber cables.</p>
<p>Fiber communications are already extensively used within metropolitan areas (<em>metro fiber links</em>), and even <a href="fiber_to_the_home.html" title="fiber to the home: the technology of providing data connections to private homes via optical fibers rather than electric cables"><em>fiber to the home</em></a> (FTTH) spreads more and more &ndash; particularly in Japan, where private Internet users can already obtain affordable Internet connections with data rates of 100&nbsp;Mbit/s &ndash; well above the performance of current ADSL systems, which use electrical telephone lines.
In other countries, one often tries to squeeze out higher transmission capacities from existing copper cables, e.g. with the technique of vectoring, in order to avoid the cost of laying down fiber cables to the premises.
This, however, is more and more seen only as a temporary solution, which cannot satisfy further growth of bandwidth demand.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Telecom Windows</h2>
<div>
<p>Optical fiber communications typically operate in a <a href="wavelength.html" title="wavelength: the spatial period of a plane wave">wavelength</a> region corresponding to one of the following &ldquo;telecom windows&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first window at 800&ndash;900&nbsp;nm was originally used.
GaAs/AlGaAs-based <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a> and <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="light-emitting diodes: semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light-emitting diodes</a> (LEDs) served as transmitters, and silicon <a href="photodiodes.html" title="photodiodes: semiconductor devices with a p&ndash;n or p&ndash;i&ndash;n structure for the detection of light">photodiodes</a> were suitable for the receivers.
However, the fiber losses are relatively high in this region, and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> are not well developed for this spectral region.
Therefore, the first telecom window is suitable only for short-distance transmission.</li>
<li>The second telecom window utilizes wavelengths around 1.3&nbsp;&mu;m, where the loss of <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a> is much lower and the fibers' <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> is very weak, so that dispersive broadening is minimized.
This window was originally used for long-haul transmission.
However, <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> for 1.3&nbsp;&mu;m (based on, e.g. on praseodymium-doped glass) are not as good as their 1.5-&mu;m counterparts based on <a href="erbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="erbium-doped gain media: laser gain media doped with erbium ions">erbium</a>.
Also, low dispersion is not necessarily ideal for long-haul transmission, as it can increase the effect of optical <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>.</li>
<li>The third telecom window, which is now very widely used, utilizes wavelengths around 1.5&nbsp;&mu;m.
The losses of silica fibers are lowest in this region, and <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a> are available which offer very high performance.
Fiber <a href="dispersion.html" title="dispersion: the dependence of the phase velocity in a medium on the optical frequency or the propagation mode">dispersion</a> is usually anomalous but can be tailored with great flexibility (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="dispersion_shifted_fibers.html" title="dispersion-shifted fibers: fibers with a non-standard zero dispersion wavelength"><em>dispersion-shifted fibers</em></a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The second and third telecom windows are further subdivided into the following wavelength bands:</p>

<p>The second and third telecom windows were originally separated by a pronounced loss peak around 1.4&nbsp;&mu;m, but they can effectively be joined with advanced fibers with low OH content which do not exhibit this peak.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">System Design</h2>
<div>
<p>The simplest type of fiber-optic communication system is a <a href="fiber_optic_links.html" title="fiber-optic links: optical communication links where the signal light is transported in fibers"><em>fiber-optic link</em></a> providing a point-to-point connection with a single data channel.
Such a link essentially contains a transmitter for sending the information optically, a transmission fiber for transmitting the light over some distance, and a receiver.
The transmission fiber may be equipped with additional components such as <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> for regenerating the <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> or <a href="dispersion_compensation.html" title="dispersion compensation: the control of the overall chromatic dispersion of a system by adding optical elements with a suitable amount of dispersion">dispersion compensators</a> for counteracting the effects of <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>.
The article on <a href="fiber_optic_links.html" title="fiber-optic links: optical communication links where the signal light is transported in fibers">fiber-optic links</a> gives more details.</p>
<p>A typical channel capacity for long-haul transmission is nowadays 2.5 or 10&nbsp;Gbit/s; 40, 100 or even 160&nbsp;Gbit/s may be used in the future.
More advanced systems increase the transmission capacity by simultaneously using several, dozens or even hundreds of different wavelength channels (<em>coarse or dense <a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="wavelength division multiplexing: a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain">wavelength division multiplexing</a></em>).
The main challenges are to suppress channel cross-talk via <a href="nonlinearities.html" title="nonlinearities: optical phenomena involving a nonlinear response to a driving light field">nonlinearities</a>, to balance the channel powers (e.g. with <a href="gain_equalization.html" title="gain equalization: a technique for making the gain spectrum of an optical amplifier device flatter over a certain optical frequency range">gain-flattened</a> <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a>), and to simplify the systems.
Another approach is <a href="time_division_multiplexing.html" title="time division multiplexing: a multiplexing technique operating in the time domain"><em>time division multiplexing</em></a>, where several input channels are combined by nesting in the time domain, and <a href="solitons.html" title="solitons: pulses with a certain balance of nonlinear and dispersive effects">solitons</a> are often used to ensure that the sent <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> stay cleanly separated even at small pulse-to-pulse spacings.</p>
<p>Another important development is that of systems which link many different stations with a sophisticated <a href="fiber_optic_networks.html" title="fiber-optic networks: communication systems consisting of fiber-optic links"><em>fiber-optic network</em></a>.
This approach can be very flexible and powerful, but also raises a number of non-trivial technical issues, such as the need for adding or dropping wavelength channels, ideally in a fully reconfigurable manner, or to constantly readjust the connection topology so as to obtain optimum performance, or to properly handle faults so as to minimize their impact on the overall system performance.
As many different concepts (e.g. concerning topologies, modulation formats, <a href="dispersion_management.html" title="dispersion management: the use of tailored chromatic dispersion to enhance the function of optical devices or systems">dispersion management</a>, nonlinear management, and software) and new types of devices (senders, receivers, fibers, fiber components, electronic circuits) are constantly being developed, it is not clear so far which kind of system will dominate the future of optical fiber communications.</p>
<p>For a discussion of aspects such as <a href="bit_error_rate.html" title="bit error rate: average fraction of wrongly transmitted bits in a communication link">bit error rates</a> and power penalties, see the article on <a href="optical_data_transmission.html" title="optical data transmission: the transmission of information using light beams, e.g. in fibers">optical data transmission</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Transmission Capacity of Optical Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>Within the last 30&nbsp;years, the transmission capacity of optical fibers has been increased enormously.
The rise in available transmission <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> per fiber is even significantly faster than e.g. the increase in storage capacity of electronic memory chips, or in the increase in computation power of microprocessors.</p>
<p>The transmission capacity of a fiber depends on the fiber length.
The longer a fiber is, the more detrimental certain effects such intermodal or <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> are, and the lower is the achievable transmission rate.</p>
<p>For short distances of a few hundred meters or less (e.g. within storage area networks), it is often more convenient to utilize <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>, as these are cheaper to install (for example, due to their large <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">core</a> areas, they are easier to splice).
Depending on the transmitter technology and fiber length, they achieve data rates between a few hundred Mbit/s and &asymp;&thinsp;10&nbsp;Gbit/s.</p>
<p><a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">Single-mode fibers</a> are typically used for longer distances of a few kilometers or more.
Currently used commercial telecom systems typically transmit 10&nbsp;Gbit/s or 40&nbsp;Gbit/s per data channel over distances of ten kilometers or more.
The newest available systems (as of 2014) reach 100&nbsp;Gbit/s, and future systems may use higher data rates per channel of e.g. 160&nbsp;Gbit/s.
The required total capacity is usually obtained by transmitting many channels with slightly different wavelengths through fibers; this is called <a href="wavelength_division_multiplexing.html" title="wavelength division multiplexing: a multiplexing technique working in the wavelength domain"><em>wavelength division multiplexing</em></a> (WDM).
Total data rates can be over 1&nbsp;Tbit/s, sufficient for transmitting many millions of telephone channels simultaneously.
Even that capacity does not reach by far the physical limit of an optical fiber.
In addition, note that a fiber-optic cable can contain multiple fibers; it is also possible to utilize <a href="multi_core_fibers.html" title="multi-core fibers: optical fibers containing more than one fiber core">multi-core fibers</a>, where multiple fiber cores are contained in a single fiber.
Furthermore, spatial division multiplexing can also be realized with <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>, using multiple-input multiple-output receiver technology.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there should be no concern that technical limitations to fiber-optic data transmission could become severe in the foreseeable future.
On the contrary, the fact that data transmission capacities can evolve faster than e.g. data storage and computational power, has inspired some people to predict that any transmission limitations will soon become obsolete, and large computation and storage facilities within high-capacity data networks will be extensively used, in a similar way as it has become common to use electrical power from many power stations within a large power grid.
Such developments may be more severely limited by software and security issues than by the limitations of data transmission.</p>
