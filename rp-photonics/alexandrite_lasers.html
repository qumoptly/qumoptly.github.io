<p>Alexandrite lasers are <a href="chromium_doped_gain_media.html" title="chromium-doped gain media: laser gain media doped with chromium ions">chromium-doped</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state lasers</a> based on the crystalline gain medium alexandrite, which is Cr<sup>3+</sup>:BeAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.
There are natural alexandrite gem stones, but material for <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystals</a> is artificially produced and grown in monocrystalline form with high crystal quality, using a modified Czochralski growth method.
The laser-active Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions substitute aluminum ions in the host crystal; there are two different possible sites for them, but normally most of the ions sit in so-called mirror sites.
Emission wavelengths are typically between 0.7&nbsp;&mu;m and 0.8&nbsp;&mu;m &ndash; in many cases around 0.75&nbsp;&mu;m, where the maximum laser <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> and <a href="wall_plug_efficiency.html" title="wall-plug efficiency: total electrical-to-optical power efficiency of a laser system">wall-plug efficiency</a> can be achieved.
The large emission bandwidth is typical for <a href="transition_metal_doped_gain_media.html" title="transition-metal-doped gain media: laser gain media which are doped with transition metal ions">transition-metal-doped gain media</a>.
It is possible to make broadly <a href="tunable_lasers.html" title="tunable lasers: lasers the output wavelengths of which can be tuned">wavelength-tunable lasers</a> based on alexandrite, which sometimes reach out to well above 0.8&nbsp;&mu;m.
Alexandrite was one of the first few <a href="vibronic_lasers.html" title="vibronic lasers: lasers based on gain media with a large gain bandwidth, caused by a strong interaction of electronic transitions with phonons">vibronic laser gain media</a>, discovered in the late 1970s.
Note, however, that it can be also used for narrowband lasing on the so-called R line, i.e., not in vibronic mode.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Alexandrite is highly anisotropic.</aside>
<p>Alexandrite has a orthorhombic crystal structure, having a low symmetry.
As a consequence of that, the absorption and gain properties strongly depend on the direction of <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">polarization</a> of light.
This together with the strong <a href="birefringence.html" title="birefringence: the polarization dependence of the refractive index of a medium">birefringence</a> of the material makes it easy to obtain linearly <a href="polarization_of_laser_emission.html" title="polarization of laser emission: direction of the electric field oscillation of a laser beam">polarized emission</a> with low <a href="depolarization_loss.html" title="depolarization loss: losses of optical power in a laser resonator, caused by depolarization e.g. in a laser crystal">depolarization losses</a>.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Alexandrite rods can not only tolerate elevated temperatures, but may even work better there.</aside>
<p>The spectroscopic properties of alexandrite are substantially more complicated than those of Nd:YAG, for example &ndash; not only due to the directional dependence, but also because of the strong involvement of phonons (quantized lattice vibrations) in the lower laser level.
An unusual phenomenon is that the achievable laser <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a> and efficiency are highest not at low temperatures, but at elevated temperatures of e.g. 100&ndash;150&thinsp;&deg;C.
This is caused by the fact that the upper laser level has a slightly higher excitation energy than a long-lived level just below it; therefore, a thermal excitation step is involved in the laser process.
As a result, pulsed alexandrite lasers often work better with elevated temperatures of the laser crystal.
For <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="continuous-wave operation: operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous-wave</a> lasers, however, the reduced <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="upper-state lifetime: the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">upper-state lifetime</a> at elevated temperatures can degrade the performance.
(Note that the upper-state lifetime is less relevant in case of pulsed pumping and rapid energy extraction.)</p>
<aside class="callout blue">The high saturation fluence of alexandrite &ndash; particularly for wavelengths away from the omission maximum &ndash; can be a problem for energy extraction in pulsed lasers.</aside>
<p>Another practically important detail is that the <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="transition cross sections: material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">emission cross sections</a> of alexandrite are rather small, which leads to a very high <a href="saturation_energy.html" title="saturation energy: a measure of the incident optical pulse energy required for achieving significant saturation of an absorber or a gain medium">saturation fluence</a>.
This can make it difficult to efficiently extract the stored energy in a laser crystal; note that the applicable intracavity laser intensities are limited by <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage</a>.
Particularly for pulsed operation well away from the optimum wavelength region around 750&nbsp;nm, the laser efficiency can be substantially reduced due to that problem.</p>
<p>Although large alexandrite crystals can be fabricated with high optical quality, the effective <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">optical damage threshold</a> for large beam area can be far below the intrinsic damage threshold as can be measured on high-quality spots which are selected for particularly low scattering losses.
Usually, optical damage is observed at crystal surfaces, not in the bulk material.
The applicable peak intensities or fluence is in pulsed lasers or <a href="amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers: devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifiers</a> are strongly dependent on the crystal quality.
Tentatively, a high crystal quality is more difficult to achieve in combination with a high Cr<sup>3+</sup> <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="doping concentration: the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Lamp-pumped Alexandrite Lasers</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">Alexandrite rods can be pumped with very powerful flash lamps, with which one could fracture Nd:YAG rods.</aside>
<p>In many cases, roughly 10&nbsp;cm long cylindrical laser <a href="rod_lasers.html" title="rod lasers: solid-state lasers with a rod-shaped gain medium">rods</a> with a diameter of e.g. 6.3&thinsp;mm (1/4 inch) are used and <a href="lamp_pumped_lasers.html" title="lamp-pumped lasers: lasers which are pumped with flash lamps or arc lamps, or in rare cases with tungsten halogen lamps">lamp-pumped</a> with one or two xenon flash lamps.
Due to the particularly high mechanical and thermo-mechanical strength of the material and its benign thermo-optical properties, very high pump powers can be applied to the flash lamps (often with average powers of several kilowatts) &ndash; substantially more than in lamp-pumped <a href="yag_lasers.html" title="YAG lasers: lasers based on YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) crystals, usually Nd:YAG or Yb:YAG">Nd:YAG lasers</a>, for example.
(One sometimes uses particularly powerful xenon lamps which would be able to fracture a Nd:YAG rod.)
Pulse energies of e.g. 1&nbsp;J or even several joules can be readily obtained with relatively simple <a href="laser_resonators.html" title="laser resonators: optical resonators serving as basic building blocks of lasers">laser resonators</a>, which however deliver a relatively poor <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> &ndash; <a href="m2_factor.html" title="<i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor: a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams">M<sup>2</sup> factors</a> of the order of 10 or larger are typically obtained.</p>
<p>It is possible to optimize laser resonators for substantially higher beam quality, but this requires more sophisticated laser resonator designs and normally leads to substantially lower output pulse energies and power conversion efficiencies.
It is possible to apply an <a href="unstable_resonators.html" title="unstable resonators: optical resonators which are dynamically unstable with respect to transverse beam offsets">unstable resonator</a> for obtaining a better trade-off between power efficiency and beam quality, but due to the low emission <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="transition cross sections: material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">cross section</a> of alexandrite, this method does not work as well as for some other lasers; one needs to use a relatively low magnification.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">Free-running pulsed lasers emit rather long pulses; with Q switching and particularly with cavity dumping, far shorter pulses and higher peak powers are possible.</aside>
<p>In most cases, flash lamps are used; pump pulse energies are typically of the order of hundreds of joules or several kilojoules, and the <a href="pulse_repetition_rate.html" title="pulse repetition rate: the number of pulses emitted per second e.g. by a mode-locked or Q-switched laser">pulse repetition rate</a> is normally quite low &ndash; for example, 10&nbsp;Hz or 30&nbsp;Hz.
In the easiest case, one uses a free-running laser, producing relatively long pulses, e.g with durations of hundreds of microseconds or even many milliseconds.
By far shorter pulse durations of the order of 30&nbsp;ns or lower can be achieved by active or passive <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q switching</a>, where lasing is prohibited for a while, until a substantial amount of energy is stored in the laser crystal, and intends pulse emission begins only then.
The possible <a href="peak_power.html" title="peak power: maximum optical power of a pulse">peak power</a> is much higher in that regime, although the power conversion efficiency is significantly lower.
For active Q switching, one would typically use an <a href="electro_optic_modulators.html" title="electro-optic modulators: optical modulators based on the electro-optic effect">electro-optic modulator</a>.
It is also possible to use <a href="cavity_dumping.html" title="cavity dumping: a method for extracting intense short or ultrashort pulses from a laser, using an optical switch in the laser resonator">cavity dumping</a> in order to achieve even shorter pulse durations of e.g. a few nanoseconds.</p>
<p>Efficient energy extraction is more easily achieved in an <a href="amplifiers.html" title="amplifiers: devices for amplifying the power of light beams">amplifier</a> than in a <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="Q-switched lasers: lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched laser</a>, because one has better control over the intensity profile (avoiding hot spots, for example).
Therefore, the architecture of a <a href="master_oscillator_power_amplifier.html" title="master oscillator power amplifier: a laser system consisting of a seed laser and a laser amplifier for boosting the output power">master oscillator power amplifier</a> (MOPA) can offer better performance, of course at the cost of a higher complexity.
Note that with this approach it is also possible to do spectral filtering between oscillator and amplifier, so that one can obtain and mission with a smaller <a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to pump alexandrite lasers with continuously operated Xe or Hg arc lamps, with which one can realize <a href="continuous_wave_operation.html" title="continuous-wave operation: operation mode of a laser with continuous light emission">continuous wave operation</a>, but also <a href="q_switching.html" title="Q switching: a method for obtaining energetic pulses from lasers by modulating the intracavity losses">Q-switched operation</a> with a high pulse repetition rate of e.g. several tens of kilohertz or <a href="mode_locking.html" title="mode locking: a group of techniques for generating ultrashort pulses in lasers">mode-locked operation</a>.</p>
<p>For particularly high output average powers, a zig-zag <a href="slab_lasers.html" title="slab lasers: solid-state bulk lasers where the gain medium has the form of a slab">slab laser</a> design may be used, where thermally introduced beam distortions are reduced.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">End-pumped Alexandrite Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>It is also possible to apply the method of <a href="end_pumping.html" title="end pumping: a technique of optically pumping a laser medium in a direction along the laser beam">end pumping</a> to alexandrite lasers.
This has first been tried in the late 1970s, using continuous-wave Nd:YAG lasers as pump sources.
End pumping allows one to pump a limited volume of laser crystal material, so that the generated laser beam has a good spatial overlap with the excited volume.
It thus becomes substantially easier to obtain a high power conversion efficiency and high <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>, for example; also, narrowband laser pumping can very much improve the power conversion efficiency.
However, the use of a laser instead of one or two lamps for pumping greatly increases the cost of the device.
Therefore, this approach is relatively seldom used.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications of Alexandrite Lasers</h2>
<div>
<p>The most important application area of alexandrite lasers is dermatology.
For example, such lasers are used for hair removal, for removing tattoos and for treating visible leg veins and pigmented lesions.
In the case of hair removal, the light from a long-pulse laser is preferentially absorbed at the hair shafts, and the resulting heat damages these hair shafts and the surrounding hair follicles (<em>selective photothermolysis</em>).
By cooling the skin during the treatment, damage to the epidermis is minimized.
The short emission wavelength of an alexandrite laser, compared with that of a Nd:YAG laser, is beneficial for removing finer hairs, but increases the risk of skin damage in case of darker skin.
(The absorption occurs mostly in melanin, which occurs in hair but also in dark skin, and less in hemoglobin.)</p>
<p>Tattoos can be removed or at least lightened by applying light which can be absorbed by the used ink, which is then chemically transformed and subsequently removed by the body.
The short pulse duration obtained with a <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="Q-switched lasers: lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched laser</a> favors the preferential heating of small ink particles.
In comparison to ruby lasers, the high pulse repetition rates and average power of alexandrite lasers is beneficial for such applications.</p>
<p>In dermatological applications, high intensity pulses from a free-running laser are normally applied to large areas of skin.
The high pulse energy and average power allow for a reasonably short treatment time.
Due to the large beam area, there are no special requirements on <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a>.
This means that relatively simple lasers can be used for such purposes.</p>
<p>The substantial <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tunability</a>, which is made possible by the wide emission spectrum of alexandrite, can be exploited in <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy: methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized">laser spectroscopy</a>.
However, in this application area alexandrite lasers are not often used, partly because <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers: lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers</a> offer much broader tunability in that wavelength region and also exhibit much larger <a href="transition_cross_sections.html" title="transition cross sections: material parameters for quantifying the likelihood or rate of optical transition events">transition cross sections</a>, which can be advantageous in various respects. </p>

<h2>Business Disputes</h2>
<p>Occasionally, serious disputes arise, e.g. when a company purchases a laser from some supplier. Conflicting views may occur concerning questions as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the <a href="beam_qualitybf4a.html?banner=arbitration">beam quality</a> consistent with the somewhat vague specifications?</li>
<li>Is it normal that the laser pulses exhibit substantial <a href="timing_jitterbf4a.html?banner=arbitration">timing jitter</a>?</li>
<li>Should it be considered as acceptable that the laser stays within specifications only if its alignment is optimized quite often by the user?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mediation</h3>
<p>Going to court is usually the last thing you want to do &ndash; but how else to resolve a conflict?</p>
<p>Mediation is a much more attractive approach. Only, you need to find a mediator</p>
<ul>
<li>who fully understands the technical matters, and</li>
<li>who can be trusted to be impartial and fair.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="paschottabf4a.html?banner=arbitration">Dr. Paschotta</a> from RP Photonics offers such services. Your chance is to reach a fair resolution with far less time and money than at court.</p>

<h2>The Transparent Laser</h2>
<p>The dream of each laser developer, and not only of each laser scientist: have a <b>transparent laser</b>, where you can <b>look into any components</b> and see e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>optical intensities</li>
<li>excitation densities of laser-active ions</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and this at any location and time, with arbitrary resolution!</p>
<p>If you had this, finally you could</p>
<ul>
<li>fully understand what goes on in your laser,</li>
<li>quickly identify and fix any problems, and</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">make faster progress <br> while saving a lot of money.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely marvelous, but only a dream?!?</p>
<p>Good news: such transparent lasers can be made!
