<p>Most optical <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> have a single <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a>, which is usually located on the fiber axis.
However, there are also <a href="specialty_fibers.html" title="specialty fibers: optical fibers with special designs or materials">specialty fibers</a> containing multiple cores, which may e.g. be arranged on a ring around the fiber axis or on some 2D grid.
(For example, a seven-core fiber may have six cores on the edges of the hexagon and a central core in addition &ndash; see Figure&nbsp;1.)
Such fibers are called <em>multi-core fibers</em> (or <em>multicore fibers</em>).</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Fabrication</h2>
<div>
<p>Multi-core fibers can be realized with classical all-glass fiber technology or alternatively as <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="photonic crystal fibers: specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a> containing air holes.
In the first case, an all-glass preform must be fabricated which contains multiple cores.
Not all standard fabrication techniques for preforms can be used for such structures, but e.g. the rod-in-tube technique.
For <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="photonic crystal fibers: specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a>, no special extension of the fabrication technology is required; one can simply assemble a more complex bundle of rods and/or tubes to obtain a preform with multiple cores.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Guiding in Multiple Cores</h2>
<div>
<figure class="right" style="width:200px;">
<img src="img/multi_core_fiber.png" alt="multi-core fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Design of a seven-core fiber with hexagonal lattice structure.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In principle, each of the fiber cores in such a fiber can act as a separate <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a>, so that light can independently propagate through those cores.
However, there can be some <a href="mode_coupling.html" title="mode coupling: a concept for describing and calculating light propagation in certain situations, e.g. involving nonlinear interactions">mode coupling</a> between the cores (see Figure&nbsp;2) if the distance between two cores is so small that the corresponding mode fields have a significant spatial overlap.
This means that light which is initially coupled into one core can eventually couple over to other cores; that effect is similar as in fused <a href="fiber_couplers.html" title="fiber couplers: fiber devices for coupling light from one or several input fibers to one or several output fibers, or from free space into a fiber">fiber couplers</a>.</p>
<p>For such a situation, one can compute so-called <em>supermodes</em>, i.e., field configurations which are stationary despite the coupling.
Note, however, that supermodes calculated in mode coupling theory for an idealized situation may not be the true modes of a fiber subject to random fluctuations in fabrication and/or due to operation conditions.
Light propagation in such fibers can also be investigated with methods of numerical beam propagation, where one may also take into account random fluctuations.</p>
<p>Although in some cases the mentioned kind of coupling is desired, in many others it is avoided or minimized by using large enough spacings between the cores.
For example, one often  wants to avoid substantial crosstalk in <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communication</a> systems.
Often, the fiber cores have rather small diameters of a few micrometers, so that <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode propagation</a> is obtained in some wavelength range.
A distance of the order of 30 to 40&nbsp;&mu;m between each pair of cores may then be sufficient to avoid significant coupling even within kilometers of fiber.
The usual fiber diameter of 125&nbsp;&mu;m then allows only for a quiet limited number of cores in such weakly-coupled fibers.
There is obviously a trade-off between a high core density and low crosstalk e.g. in telecom systems.
That trade-off can be mitigated in various ways, e.g. by reducing the coupling by stronger mode confinement (e.g. with refractive index trenches or air holes around the cores), or with heterogeneous designs where the different core modes have different <a href="effective_refractive_index.html" title="effective refractive index: a number quantifying the phase delay per unit length in a waveguide, relative to the phase delay in vacuum">effective refractive indices</a>.
In principle, one can also increase the fiber diameter, but that is often not practical, because the sensitivity of the fiber to bending is then increased.</p>

In this example, the spacing between the cores is 20&nbsp;&mu;m, and the fiber design has not been optimized for low coupling. Here, we obtain substantial coupling within only a few millimeters of fiber.

<h2 class="togglediv">Telecom Applications</h2>
<div>
<aside class="callout blue">Multi-core fibers one of the technological options for realizing spatial division multiplexing.</aside>
<p>In <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, there is a long-term trend towards more and more expanding the transmission capacities, as data traffic keeps growing at a large rate.
Obviously, there is thus an interest in maximizing the transmission capacity per fiber, and one of the technological options is using multiple cores in one fiber, so that multiple signals can be simultaneously transmitted with spatial separation (<em>space division multiplexing</em>, SDM).
That principle can also be realized with <a href="few_mode_fibers.html" title="few-mode fibers: fibers supporting only few guided modes">few-mode fibers</a> or <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>, but multi-core fibers allow for realization with much weaker coupling between the channels.
The two approaches may even be combined when using multiple multimode cores, which can result in a larger number of transmission channels.</p>
<aside class="callout red">Significant coupling between the fiber cores is not necessarily detrimental for applications!</aside>
<p>When using fibers with negligibly weak coupling between the cores over the full transmission distance, the system can be conceptually simpler.
However, fibers with relatively strong mode coupling can also be employed, using techniques of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) digital signal processing.
In the latter case, the spacing between the cores can be much smaller, so that more fiber cores can be placed in a single fiber, and the overall transmission capacity can be higher.
The same kind of techniques can be used in conjunction with <a href="few_mode_fibers.html" title="few-mode fibers: fibers supporting only few guided modes">few-mode fibers</a> and <a href="multimode_fibers.html" title="multimode fibers: fibers supporting more than one guided mode per polarization direction">multimode fibers</a>.
Compared with those, single-mode multi-core fibers have the advantage that the spread of group velocities is much smaller, which allows the use of MIMO receiver with smaller complexity.</p>
<aside class="callout green">How to couple light in and out of multiple fiber cores?</aside>
<p>A substantial technical challenge for the industrial use of multi-core fibers is the need to couple light for multiple signal channels into the different cores of the fiber, and to handle outputs from multiple cores.
Suitable coupler devices also have to satisfy a number of practical requirements.
One of the proposed solutions is to use laser-inscribed 3D <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguides</a> in a small glass block, which connect different cores of a MCF with the cores of a set of output or input fibers which are arranged in a linear sequence [3].</p>
<p>Another challenge is that <a href="fusion_splicing_of_fibers.html" title="fusion splicing of fibers: a technique of making low-loss fiber joints by fusing fiber ends together">splicing</a> of multi-core fibers is obviously more difficult than for ordinary single-core fibers.</p>
<aside class="callout blue">There are interesting options for fiber amplifiers which can be applied to multi-core fibers.</aside>
<p>For long transmission distances, <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> are often employed.
Special <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a> for multi-core fibers have been developed, where simultaneous amplification for all the cores is achieved, in some cases even using only a single pump source.
Further research and development of such multi-core EDFAs [6] is required, paying attention to technical issues like core-dependent gain.
There are realizations based on <a href="double_clad_fibers.html" title="double-clad fibers: optical fibers with different waveguide structures for pump and signal light">cladding-pumped</a> active fibers where only one or two pumped lasers are required and the differential model gain can still be quite limited [14].</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Other Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>Multi-core fibers can also be utilized for other (non-telecom) applications.
An example is the area of <a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="fiber-optic sensors: optical sensors based on fiber devices">fiber-optic sensors</a>.
Possible operation principles can exploit the sensitivity of coupling between multiple cores to external influences such as strain or temperature changes.
Such sensors may be realized in the form of <a href="interferometers.html" title="interferometers: optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometers</a> involving light passes through different cores.</p>

<h2>Short-term Software Licenses Available</h2>
<p>Do you need simulation software (such as our <a href="fiberpower12c6.html?banner=rented_software">RP Fiber Power</a>) only during a <b>short-term project</b>?</p>
<p>Or do you want to <b>test such software very thoroughly</b> before fully committing to it?</p>
<p>RP Photonics is now offering a solution: <a href="software_licenses12c6.html?banner=rented_software">software licenses</a> which are valid for a <b>limited time</b>.</p>
<p>Our conditions are very fair:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay only 5% of the amount for a permanent license for one month.</li>
<li>When switching over to a permanent license directly thereafter, get the already paid money fully deducted!</li>
<li>If you decide for that only later on, still get two thirds deducted.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are confident that you will like our software and finally decide for permanent licenses.</p>
