<p>Superluminescent diodes (also sometimes called <em>superluminescence diodes</em> or <em>superluminescent light-emitting diodes</em> = <em>superluminescent LEDs</em>) are <a href="optoelectronics.html" title="optoelectronics: the technology of electronic devices that interact with light">optoelectronic</a> semiconductor devices which emit broadband optical radiation based on <a href="superluminescence.html" title="superluminescence: fluorescence which is enhanced by laser amplification">superluminescence</a>.
In terms of construction, they are similar to <a href="laser_diodes.html" title="laser diodes: semiconductor lasers with a current-carrying p&ndash;n junction as the gain medium">laser diodes</a>, containing an electrically driven p&ndash;n junction and an optical <a href="waveguides.html" title="waveguides: spatially inhomogeneous transparent structures for guiding light">waveguide</a>.
Importantly, however, SLDs lack optical feedback by reflections, so that no <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> action can occur.
Parasitic optical feedback from the facets, which could lead to the formation of <a href="resonator_modes.html" title="resonator modes: modes of an optical or microwave resonator">resonator modes</a> and thus to pronounced structures in the <a href="optical_spectrum.html" title="optical spectrum: the decomposition of the power or energy of light according to different wavelengths or optical frequencies">optical spectrum</a> and/or to spectral narrowing, is suppressed by means of tilting the facets relative to the waveguide, and can be suppressed further with <a href="anti_reflection_coatings.html" title="anti-reflection coatings: optical thin-film coatings for reducing reflections from surfaces">anti-reflection coatings</a>.
Essentially, an SLD is a <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="semiconductor optical amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifier</a> with no input signal, where weak <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="spontaneous emission: a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a> into the waveguide mode is followed by strong laser amplification (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="amplified_spontaneous_emission.html" title="amplified spontaneous emission: a process where spontaneously emitted radiation (luminescence) is amplified"><em>amplified spontaneous emission</em></a>).</p>
<p>A frequently used acronym for the superluminescent diode is SLD.
The alternative acronym SLED is also used for <em>surface-emitting LED</em>, i.e., with a totally different meaning, so that confusion can arise.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Wavelength, Power, and Optical Bandwidth</h2>
<div>
<p>Most superluminescent diodes emit in one of the wavelength regions around 800&nbsp;nm, 1300&nbsp;nm, and 1550&nbsp;nm.
However, devices for other wavelengths are available, also in the visible domain.</p>
<p>Typical output powers are in the range from a few milliwatts to some tens of milliwatts, and spatially the emission is close to <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a>, i.e., the spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="coherence: a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> and <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> are very high.
Therefore, the broadband output can be easily launched into a <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>.
<a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">Fiber-coupled</a> SLDs are in fact most common.</p>
<p>The optical bandwidth of an SLD is usually some tens of nanometers, sometimes even above 100&nbsp;nm.
This corresponds to a <a href="coherence_length.html" title="coherence length: a measure of temporal coherence, expressed as the propagation distance over which the coherence significantly decays">coherence length</a> of a few tens of microns, sometimes even only a few microns.
Due to <a href="gain_narrowing.html" title="gain narrowing: the phenomenon that the bandwidth of light can be reduced during amplification in a medium with a limited gain bandwidth">gain narrowing</a>, there is a trade-off between high output power and broad bandwidth, which can however be improved with various methods.
This trade-off, and not the lack of optical feedback, is the main reason why SLDs deliver lower <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> than laser diodes.</p>
<p>Another factor, which is important for some applications, is wavelength stability, particularly under conditions of variable temperatures and aging.
Typically, the center wavelength drifts by some fraction of a nanometer per Kelvin temperature change, following the drift of the semiconductor's gain spectrum.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Various Technical Issues</h2>
<div>
<p>SLDs should be carefully protected against external optical feedback.
Even small levels of feedback can reduce the overall emission bandwidth and the output power, or sometimes even lead to <a href="parasitic_lasing.html" title="parasitic lasing: unwanted laser operation in a laser or amplifier device">parasitic lasing</a>, causing narrow spikes in the emission spectrum.
Some devices may even be damaged by optical feedback.
Note that the Fresnel reflection from a perpendicularly cleaved fiber end is already well above the level of feedback which can be tolerated.</p>
<p>To a similar extent as laser diodes, SLDs are sensitive to electrostatic discharges and current spikes e.g. from ill-designed driver electronics.
However, when treated carefully and operated well within the specifications, SLDs can easily last for tens of thousands of hours of operation.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>SLDs are applied in situations where a smooth and broadband optical spectrum (i.e. low temporal coherence), combined with high spatial coherence and relatively high intensity, is required.
Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="optical_coherence_tomography.html" title="optical coherence tomography: an optical imaging technique where longitudinal resolution is achieved based on interference effects with low-coherence light">Optical coherence tomography</a> (OCT), e.g. for cornea and retina diagnostics, for cardiovascular imaging, for other biomedical purposes or for biology research, requires a broad bandwidth for a high spatial resolution of the images, and a sufficiently high optical power for fast image acquisition with good <a href="signal_to_noise_ratio.html" title="signal-to-noise ratio: the ratio of signal power to noise power in a detector">signal-to-noise ratio</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> of <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> and other optical components is often measured with techniques which require some broadband light source (see also: <a href="white_light_sources.html" title="white light sources: light sources with very broad optical bandwidth">white light sources</a>).
An example is <a href="white_light_interferometers.html" title="white light interferometers: interferometers using broadband light inputs">white light interferometry</a>.</li>
<li>Broadband light can be used for testing of <a href="optoelectronics.html" title="optoelectronics: the technology of electronic devices that interact with light">optoelectronic</a> components, e.g. in terms of transmission or reflection spectra, amplification factors, dispersion, and the like.
This is used e.g. for diagnosing problems in <a href="fiber_optic_links.html" title="fiber-optic links: optical communication links where the signal light is transported in fibers">fiber-optic links</a> by measuring <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> or polarization mode dispersion.
For such purposes, devices emitting around 1.3&nbsp;&mu;m or 1.5&nbsp;&mu;m are usually applied.</li>
<li>Some types of <a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="fiber-optic sensors: optical sensors based on fiber devices">fiber-optic sensors</a>, e.g. for measuring temperature, strain or pressure in buildings, oil pipelines or oil fields, are interrogated with broadband light sources.
High output powers can be beneficial, as they allow the interrogation of multiple sensors over long distances of optical fiber.</li>
<li>Fiber-optic gyroscopes, as used e.g. for navigation of large airplanes, benefit from a broadband light source.
The Sagnac phase shift associated with a rotation can in principle also be measured with a <a href="ring_lasers.html" title="ring lasers: lasers with a ring resonator">ring laser</a>.
However, a broadband source allows one to implement a principle of operation which does not suffer from a phase locking phenomenon at low rotation rates, despite some scattering in the <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fiber</a>.
Further, the setup is fairly simple and robust and does not contain particularly expensive parts.
However, wavelength stability of the source is an issue which has to be carefully observed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Possible Alternatives</h2>
<div>
<p>For higher output powers, an SLD may be replaced with an unseeded <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifier</a>.
However, fiber-based sources are substantially more expensive.</p>
<p>In cases where very low optical powers are sufficient, a simple bulb may be used.
However, the <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> of a bulb is orders of magnitude smaller than that of an SLD, so the difference in, e.g., signal-to-noise ratio or speed of some measurement can be huge.</p>
<p>In principle, an SLD is a <a href="semiconductor_optical_amplifiers.html" title="semiconductor optical amplifiers: optical amplifiers based on semiconductor gain media">semiconductor optical amplifier</a> (SOA) with no input signal, but it is optimized for a good combination of output power and bandwidth, and therefore better suited for broadband light generation than an all-purpose SOA.</p>

<h2>Free Tutorial: Modeling of Fiber Amplifiers and Lasers</h2>
<p>We have published a new <a href="tutorial_modeling2a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">tutorial</a> which discusses the modeling of fiber amplifiers and lasers.
It addresses many questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a <a href="tutorial_modeling12a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">model</a>?</li>
<li>Should one use <a href="tutorial_modeling32a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">power propagation or field propagation</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate the behavior of <a href="tutorial_modeling42a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">laser-active ions</a>?</li>
<li>How to calculate <a href="tutorial_modeling52a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">steady-state solutions</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate <a href="tutorial_modeling62a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">dynamical behavior</a> and <a href="tutorial_modeling72a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">ultrashort pulse propagation</a>?</li>
<li>What aspects are important for the <a href="tutorial_modeling82a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">decision</a> whether to develop own modeling software or use commercial software?</li>
</ul>
