<p>Abstract: Nonlinear frequency conversion is often challenging when light with extremely long or short wavelengths needs to be generated. This article discusses the many reasons for that.</p>
</div>
<figure class="right" style="width:130px;">

</figure>
<p><a href="nonlinear_frequency_conversion.html" title="nonlinear frequency conversion: the conversion of input light to light of other frequencies, using optical nonlinearities">Nonlinear frequency conversion</a> &ndash; for example, <a href="frequency_doubling.html" title="frequency doubling: the phenomenon that an input wave in a nonlinear material can generate a wave with twice the optical frequency">frequency doubling</a> or optical <a href="parametric_amplification.html" title="parametric amplification: a process of optical amplification based on a parametric nonlinearity">parametric amplification</a>, can be performed in very different spectral regions.
In this article, I discuss some challenges which one encounters in extreme spectral regions.
Some of them are related to limitations of <a href="nonlinear_crystal_materials.html" title="nonlinear crystal materials: crystal materials exhibiting an optical nonlinearity, usually of &chi;<sup>(2)</sup> type">nonlinear crystal materials</a>, but there also some others.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Challenges for Short Wavelengths</h2>
<div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Optical Transparency and Phase Matching</h3>
<div>
<p>First, we obviously need to have a nonlinear crystal material with sufficient transparency.
There is a limited range of materials with good transparency in the <a href="ultraviolet_light.html" title="ultraviolet light: invisible light with wavelengths shorter than &asymp;&thinsp;400&thinsp;&thinsp;nm">ultraviolet</a> region &ndash; typically, one uses borates such as BBO or LBO.
As far as those offer suitable <a href="phase_matching.html" title="phase matching: a group of techniques for achieving efficient nonlinear interactions in a medium">phase-matching</a> schemes for the wanted nonlinear interaction, this is fine, but the limited choice of materials can of course make it difficult to obtain phase matching in a convenient way.
For example, in some cases one would really prefer to have type-I phase matching, but can only get a configuration with type-II phase matching.</p>
<p>Note also that <a href="quasi_phase_matching.html" title="quasi-phase matching: a technique of achieving a kind of phase matching, using a periodic structure">quasi-phase matching</a> is difficult to realize for ultraviolet light generation, because (a) the typically used materials (e.g. borates) are not suitable for techniques like <a href="periodic_poling.html" title="periodic poling: a technique for achieving quasi-phase matching of nonlinear interactions in a transparent crystal material">periodic poling</a> and (b) the required poling period would anyway be inconveniently small due to the strong <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> for short wavelengths.</p>
<p>If you obtain phase matching in some way, you will usually find that the <a href="phase_matching_bandwidth.html" title="phase-matching bandwidth: the width of an optical frequency range in which some process (e.g. a nonlinear interaction) can be efficient due to more or less precise phase matching">phase-matching bandwidth</a> is fairly small due to the strong <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a>, i.e., a strong wavelength dependence of the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> at short wavelengths.
This is a problem mostly for converting <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a>: the resulting <a href="group_velocity_mismatch.html" title="group velocity mismatch: the phenomenon that pulses become temporally separated in a medium due to different group velocities, or (quantitatively) the difference of inverse group velocities">group velocity mismatch</a> can easily become several picoseconds in a few millimeters.
Efficient conversion without temporally broadening the generated pulses usually requires that the overall group velocity mismatch within the crystal length stays below the <a href="pulse_duration.html" title="pulse duration: the duration of an optical pulse">pulse duration</a>.
So you have to work with a quite limited crystal length, making efficient conversion more difficult.
You may look out for crystal materials with low group velocity mismatch, but those tend to be the ones having a relatively low nonlinearity.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Optical Damage</h3>
<div>
<p>A further difficulty is that the <a href="laser_induced_damage.html" title="laser-induced damage: damage of optical components induced by laser radiation">damage thresholds</a> of optical materials are relatively low for ultraviolet light.
This is essentially because a relatively small number of <a href="photons.html" title="photons: quanta of light energy">photons</a> is sufficient to push an electron from the conduction band into the valance band.
In many cases, two photons are already sufficient &ndash; one then has substantial <a href="two_photon_absorption.html" title="two-photon absorption: a nonlinear absorption process where two photons are simultaneously absorbed">two-photon absorption</a>, which is not only inconvenient in terms of losing light but also because the generated free carriers cause additional trouble.
Typically, they are involved in damage and degradation phenomena.
Certain impurities can also contributors such effects.
Through various mechanisms of that kind, one often suffers problems like rapid degradation of crystals.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Group Velocity Mismatch</h3>
<div>
<p>For ultrashort pulses, the combination of strong group velocity mismatch with limited optical intensities (for avoiding optical damage) is particularly bad; it often severely limits the possible single-pass conversion efficiency.
In that regime, frequency conversion works better with longer pulses; one can then use longer crystals.
The stronger effect of beam divergence in a longer crystal may not be a problem, if the focusing is anyway limited by damage phenomena rather than by beam divergence.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Challenges for Long Wavelengths</h2>
<div>
<p>Light with rather long wavelengths can be generated by <a href="sum_and_difference_frequency_generation.html" title="sum and difference frequency generation: nonlinear processes generating beams with the sum or difference of the frequencies of the input beams">difference frequency generation</a>, as idler light in <a href="parametric_amplification.html" title="parametric amplification: a process of optical amplification based on a parametric nonlinearity">parametric amplification</a> or <a href="optical_parametric_oscillators.html" title="optical parametric oscillators: coherent light sources based on parametric amplification within an optical resonator">oscillation</a>, or with <a href="optical_rectification.html" title="optical rectification: a nonlinear process where an optical field generates a quasi-DC nonlinear polarization">optical rectification</a>.</p>
<h3 class="togglediv">Transparency</h3>
<div>
<p>Again, the limited transparency ranges of optical materials can then be a problem.
It is not that substantial absorption of the product wave is necessarily preventing the conversion, but of course it works against efficient conversion &ndash; not only because already generated long-wavelength light gets lost by absorption, but also because keeping its intensity down in the crystal reduces the amount of generated product light in the first place.
(One can also see that effect in the form of reduced pump depletion.)</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Beam Divergence</h3>
<div>
<p>Another problem results from the strong <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a> for focused light at long wavelengths.
This can be a particularly severe problem for the generation of <a href="terahertz_radiation.html" title="terahertz radiation: electromagnetic radiation with terahertz frequencies">terahertz radiation</a>; even if the input light can be tightly focused, that may not help very much if the generated terahertz wave diverges so strongly that it quickly loses overlap with the pump light.</p>
<p>Note also that for THz radiation the frequency bandwidth is often not much smaller than the mean frequency.
That implies that the strength of divergence varies substantially within the pulse spectrum.
That leads to complicated spatio-temporal properties of the generated light, which can make it difficult to efficiently get the light to some application.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">Low Radiation at Low Frequencies</h3>
<div>
<p>Another challenge is that the involved low frequencies make it difficult to effectively radiate light.
Consider, for example, difference frequency generation with two optical input beams.
These generate a <a href="nonlinear_polarization.html" title="nonlinear polarization: the part of the light-induced electric polarization which depends nonlinearly on the electric field of the light">nonlinear polarization</a> wave in the crystal, which then must radiate the wanted light.
Even for low generated frequencies, the generated nonlinear polarization can be quite strong.
However, the radiated power is not only proportional to the square of the amplitude of the polarization, but also to the fourth power of the generated optical frequency &ndash; this is the same dependence as for radiation of a simple oscillating dipole.
So even if you push the material as hard as it can tolerate, you won't get much power out at a low frequency.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="togglediv">The Photon Energy Problem</h3>
<div>
<p>Besides, the resulting power conversion efficiency is fundamentally limited by the photon energy issue: one higher-frequency photon is converted into one output photon and an additional photon for the lower-frequency input wave.
So the power is primarily converted from one optical wave to the other, rather than into the wanted product wave.</p>
