<p>Abstract: It is still widely believed that ytterbium-doped gain media (e.g. fibers) cannot exhibit quenching phenomena, degrading the laser or amplifier efficiency, because their simple energy level structure does not permit that. However, quenching phenomena do occur - not via energy transfer upconversion processes, but via color centers. Such a result has been published about nine years ago, but has not been noticed by many. Some devices are particularly sensitive to such effects, in particular ytterbium-doped fiber lasers operating at 975 nm.</p>

<p class="ref">Ref.: R. Paschotta et al., &ldquo;Lifetime quenching in Yb-doped fibres&rdquo;, Opt. Commun. 136, 375 (1997); encyclopedia articles on <a href="quenching.html" title="quenching: the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> and <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="ytterbium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped gain media</a></p>
<p>The message has been endlessly repeated: one of the advantages of <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="ytterbium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped gain media</a> is that their simple level scheme eliminates the possibility of <a href="quenching.html" title="quenching: the reduction or limitation of an excited-state population, mostly by unwanted effects">quenching</a> effects.
A nice message, only it's wrong.</p>
<p>During my research in the <a href="http://www.orc.soton.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">Optoelectronics Research Centre</a> in Southampton, UK, a colleague showed me a strange phenomenon: the output power of an ytterbium-doped <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber laser</a>, pumped with a <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">tunable</a> <a href="titanium_sapphire_lasers.html" title="titanium&ndash;sapphire lasers: lasers based on a Ti:sapphire gain medium">titanium&ndash;sapphire laser</a>, was highest when the pump wavelength was somewhat detuned from the wavelength of highest <a href="pump_absorption.html" title="pump absorption: the absorption of pump light, e.g. in a laser or a laser amplifier">pump absorption</a> in the fiber (around 975&nbsp;nm).
Having a simple but wrong hypothesis to explain this, he didn't care much about it.
But I insisted that this shouldn't happen, and so we undertook some experiments which lead to a model of what is going on: some fraction of the ytterbium ions are strongly quenched &ndash; most likely by some color centers in the glass &ndash;, and the pump power absorbed by those ion is fully lost.
When the pump wavelength is tuned to the maximum absorption, the &ldquo;useful&rdquo; pump absorption by non-quenched ions is strongly saturated, so that the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; absorption by quenched ions dominates, and the laser efficiency suffers.
There is also some <em>direct</em> absorption caused by the color centers, but this effect is quite weak (although clearly detectable); an <a href="energy_transfer.html" title="energy transfer: the phenomenon that dopant ions in laser-active media can exchange excitation energy among each other">energy transfer</a> from ytterbium ions to color centers makes the existence of the color centers much more detrimental.
By the way, there appears to be no general reduction of <a href="fluorescence.html" title="fluorescence: luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> <a href="upper_state_lifetime.html" title="upper-state lifetime: the lifetime of the population of the upper laser level">lifetime</a>; only some fraction of the ions is quenched, while the others appear to be fine.
Therefore, lifetime measurements cannot reveal the effect, even if it is strong.</p>
<p>It turned out that this phenomenon tends to be stronger in highly doped fibers, but without a systematic dependence on <a href="doping_concentration.html" title="doping concentration: the concentration of some dopant, e.g. of laser-active ions in a laser gain medium">doping concentration</a>.
Yet unidentified fabrication details strongly influence the strength of the phenomenon.
For some fiber lasers and <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">amplifiers</a>, quenching of a few percent of the ions doesn't really matter that much, while other devices are very sensitive &ndash; for example, fiber lasers emitting at 975&nbsp;nm, as are useful to pump <a href="erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers.html" title="erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: fiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped optical fibers">erbium-doped fiber amplifiers</a>, can have a strongly degraded efficiency.
Some heavily affected fibers even don't lase at all.</p>
<p>The first attempt to publish our technologically important finding failed: the reviewers used by Optics Letters denied the importance, based on the fact that quenching phenomena in rare-earth-doped fibers are well known (but not for ytterbium-doped media!) and that the exact cause has not been identified with certainty (but it matters anyway!).
So we finally got it published in Optics Communications (see the reference above), which however receives less attention, so that many people still don't know about it nine years later.
For that reason, others even brought up new explanations for similar findings, in particular the claim that such quenching behavior is strongly related to ytterbium ion pairs (see Kir'yanov et al., <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-14-9-3981" rel="nofollow">Opt. Express 14 (9), 3981 (2006)</a>); see my comment in <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-14-15-6981" rel="nofollow">Opt. Express 14 (15), 6981 (2006)</a>.
I suppose that the phenomenon has already puzzled quite a number of laboratories, and quite a few got onto wrong tracks, not being aware of the above mentioned publication.</p>

<h2>How PhD Students Should Get Supported by Supervisors</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="spotlight_2014_12_17af33.html?banner=supervisors">article in the Photonics Spotlight</a> discusses the responsibilities of supervisors (professors and senior research assistance).</p>
<p>Some key statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if PhD students can carry out most of the work in a research project, vital inputs are needed from supervisors particularly in the planning phase and when a crisis occurs.</li>
<li>A helpful supervisor does not only benefit the supported students, but contributes to the effectiveness of the whole research team.</li>
<li>If serious engagement were the condition of authorship of supervisors, supervisors would be more likely to do their job.</li>
<li>A substantial risk for science fraud arises only in a serious crisis &ndash; and is in that case strongly dependent on how the supervisor performs!</li>
