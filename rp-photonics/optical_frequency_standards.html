<p>Frequency standards are devices for producing or probing frequencies.
Among all physical quantities, the frequency (or time) is the one which can be measured with by far the highest precision.
Optical frequency standards are required e.g. for <a href="optical_clocks.html" title="optical clocks: time measurement devices based on optical frequency standards">optical clocks</a>, but also for <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Active and Passive Frequency Standards</h2>
<div>
<p>An <em>active</em> optical frequency standard is a kind of <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a> source emitting light with a very well-defined and known <a href="optical_frequency.html" title="optical frequency: the oscillation frequency of the electric field of light">optical frequency</a>, or sometimes a set of a few or even many well-defined optical frequency components in a <a href="frequency_combs.html" title="frequency combs: optical spectra consisting of equidistant lines">frequency comb</a>.
Combined with an <a href="optical_clockworks.html" title="optical clockworks: devices which can phase-coherently relate optical frequencies to microwave frequencies">optical clockwork</a>, such a frequency standard can form the basis of an <a href="optical_clocks.html" title="optical clocks: time measurement devices based on optical frequency standards">optical clock</a>.
Other application areas of ultraprecise optical frequency standards are high-precision <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy: methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized">spectroscopy</a>, global positioning systems, tests of the theory of relativity, and gravitational wave detection.</p>
<p>A <em>passive</em> optical frequency standard is a passive device with a well-defined frequency response, which can be used to build an active standard.
Important examples are <a href="q_factor.html" title="<i>Q</i> factor: a measure of the damping of resonator modes">high-Q</a> <a href="reference_cavities.html" title="reference cavities: optical cavities serving as a kind of frequency reference">reference cavities</a> and devices such as <a href="multipass_gas_cells.html" title="multipass gas cells: a cell which allows to realize multiple passes of a laser beam through a gas">multipass gas cells</a> for probing certain optical transitions.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Standards Based on Optical Transitions</h2>
<div>
<p>An optical frequency standard is usually based on some optically probed electronic transition (usually a <a href="forbidden_transitions.html" title="forbidden transitions: transitions between different energy levels of some atoms or ions for which dipole transitions are suppressed via symmetries">forbidden transition</a>) with narrow <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of certain atoms (e.g. Ca, Rb, Sr, Yb, Mg, or H), ions (Hg<sup>+</sup>, Sr<sup>+</sup>, Yb<sup>+</sup>, In<sup>+</sup>, Al<sup>+</sup>), or molecules (I<sub>2</sub> = iodine, CH<sub>4</sub> = methane, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> = acetylene).
This transition is used to <a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="stabilization of lasers: measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities">stabilize</a> the frequency of a <a href="single_frequency_lasers.html" title="single-frequency lasers: lasers emitting radiation in a single resonator mode">single-frequency laser</a> to the transition frequency.
In order to reduce <a href="inhomogeneous_broadening.html" title="inhomogeneous broadening: the increase in the linewidth of an atomic transition caused by effects which act differently on different radiating or absorbing atoms">inhomogeneous broadening</a> by thermal movement (<a href="doppler_broadening.html" title="Doppler broadening: broadening of the linewidth of atomic transitions, caused by random motion of the emitting atoms">Doppler broadening</a>) and collisions, the particles' density and relative velocities have to be minimized.
One possibility is to keep the particles in a trap (e.g. a Penning trap or an optical trap) within a vacuum chamber and to apply <a href="laser_cooling.html" title="laser cooling: a variety of techniques for reducing the temperature (i.e., the random motion) of small particles such as atoms or ions">laser cooling</a> in order to reduce the temperature strongly.
This allows for very precise <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy: methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized">spectroscopic</a> measurements on the clock transition.
Alternatively, such measurements can be done on laser-cooled <em>atom beams</em>.
Simple gas cells, probed e.g. with Doppler-Free spectroscopy, are used when a lower precision is sufficient.</p>
<p>In the future, it may even become possible to use certain low-energy nuclear transitions, for example of thorium 229 ions, in order to obtain still higher timing accuracies [13].</p>
<p>To serve well in a high-precision optical atomic clock, an atom, ion or molecule should meet a number of requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The clock transition should have a very narrow <a href="linewidth.html" title="linewidth: width of the spectrum of a light beam or an absorption feature">linewidth</a> (high <a href="q_factor.html" title="<i>Q</i> factor: a measure of the damping of resonator modes"><i>Q</i> factor</a>).</li>
<li>The optical clock frequency should be convenient, so that a suitable interrogation laser is available and further processing (for example the connection to an <a href="optical_clockworks.html" title="optical clockworks: devices which can phase-coherently relate optical frequencies to microwave frequencies">optical clockwork</a>) is convenient.</li>
<li>There should be other transitions suitable for <a href="laser_cooling.html" title="laser cooling: a variety of techniques for reducing the temperature (i.e., the random motion) of small particles such as atoms or ions">laser cooling</a>.</li>
<li>The clock transition should be very insensitive to external disturbing factors such as electric or magnetic fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of ions, it is often advantageous to use only a single ion in order to remove disturbances from ion&ndash;ion interactions and let the ion sit exactly at the center of the trap.
Laser cooling in a trap down to the quantum-mechanical ground state of the ion's motion is then often possible.
Interrogation of the clock transition is possible while the trap potential is turned on.
Single-ion frequency standards are nearly free from systematic frequency shifts.
However, the <a href="signal_to_noise_ratio.html" title="signal-to-noise ratio: the ratio of signal power to noise power in a detector">signal-to-noise ratio</a> for the interrogation is fairly small with a single particle.
This is detrimental for the stability of the frequency standard, because short-term deviations of the oscillator can not be well suppressed.</p>
<p>Neutral atoms can be used in much larger numbers, such as a million, to improve greatly the signal-to-noise ratio, thus allowing for very high stability of the frequency standard.
However, collisions between the atoms lead to uncontrollable frequency shifts.
Also, the magneto-optical trap often has to be switched off while interrogating the clock transition, because the light field of the trap introduces systematic frequency shifts which are difficult to eliminate.
Switching off the trap limits the interaction time and introduces Doppler-related frequency shifts.
These problems can be solved by loading the atoms into an optical lattice [7,&thinsp;11], as can be generated with superimposed <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a>, and by operating the trap with an optical frequency which is adjusted such that it its effects on the upper and lower energy level exactly cancel [11].
Such an <em>optical lattice clock</em> allows the systematic frequency shifts to be largely eliminated.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Reference Cavities as Flywheel Oscillators</h2>
<div>
<p>As the signal-to-noise ratio for the interrogation of a weak clock transition is typically small (particularly for ion traps), it is important to use a well-stabilized laser as a <em>flywheel oscillator</em>.
The laser is typically <a href="stabilization_of_lasers.html" title="stabilization of lasers: measures applied to lasers in order to improve their stability in terms of output power, optical frequency, or other quantities">stabilized</a> to a stable <a href="reference_cavities.html" title="reference cavities: optical cavities serving as a kind of frequency reference">reference cavity</a> with high <a href="q_factor.html" title="<i>Q</i> factor: a measure of the damping of resonator modes"><i>Q</i> factor</a>, which gives good short-term stability (and can itself be considered as a frequency standard).
The clock transition is then used to provide the long-term stability, which the cavity can not guarantee due to various kinds of drifts.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Accuracy, Precision, Stability</h2>
<div>
<p>The terms <em>accuracy</em>, <em>precision</em> and <em>stability</em> are well distinguished in <a href="frequency_metrology.html" title="frequency metrology: the field of technology dealing with precise frequency measurements">frequency metrology</a> (and other areas of metrology):</p>
<ul>
<li>A high accuracy means that the produced frequency, as measured by averaging over longer times, accurately matches the specified frequency.</li>
<li>A high precision means that repeated frequency measurements result in values which have a small standard deviation, i.e. which stay close to their mean value.</li>
<li>A high stability means that the produced frequency exhibits only weak drifts.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, single-ion frequency standards can be very accurate and stable, but are generally inferior to standards based on atomic clouds in terms of precision.</p>
