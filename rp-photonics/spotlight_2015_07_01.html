<p>Abstract: It is well known that in many situations the nonlinear effect of self-phase modulation (SPM) leads to a broadening of the optical spectrum of an ultrashort pulse. However, this discussion shows that in other cases SPM does not change the spectral width or even reduced it. The created insight is relevant for pulse propagation in optical fibers and in mode-locked lasers, for example.</p>

<p>For many, it seems to be common wisdom that the effect of <a href="self_phase_modulation.html" title="self-phase modulation: nonlinear phase modulation of a beam, caused by its own intensity via the Kerr effect">self-phase modulation</a> (SPM), which results from the <a href="kerr_effect.html" title="Kerr effect: a nonlinear interaction of light in a medium with an instantaneous response, related to the nonlinear electronic polarization">Kerr nonlinearity</a>, always increases the optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of an <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulse</a>.
After all, it creates a so-called <a href="chirp.html" title="chirp: time dependence of the instantaneous frequency of an optical pulse">chirp</a>, i.e., a temporal variation of the <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="instantaneous frequency: temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a>, which then runs through a wider range of frequencies.
This effect is utilized, for example, in a method of temporal <a href="pulse_compression.html" title="pulse compression: linear or nonlinear techniques for reducing the durations of optical pulses">pulse compression</a>, where one first broadens the bandwidth using SPM and then temporally compresses the pulse by applying an appropriate amount of <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> which removes the created chirp.</p>
<p>However, it should then be irritating that various example cases quite clearly contradict the mentioned belief:</p>
<ul>
<li>When fundamental <a href="solitons.html" title="solitons: pulses with a certain balance of nonlinear and dispersive effects">soliton</a> pulses propagate through an optical <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>, these continuously experience self-phase modulation.
Nevertheless, their optical bandwidth does not change at all!
Well, here we also have <a href="chromatic_dispersion.html" title="chromatic dispersion: the frequency dependence of the phase velocity in a transparent medium">chromatic dispersion</a> acting on the pulse, but that linear effect is known not to affect the optical bandwidth.
Therefore, how could the chromatic dispersion remove the bandwidth-broadening effect of the fiber nonlinearity?</li>
<li>If one injects a higher-order soliton pulse into such a fiber, its optical bandwidth changes periodically, i.e., it regularly expands and contracts again.</li>
<li>There are indeed cases where e.g. a broadband down-chirped pulse enters a fiber and leaves it with much reduced optical bandwidth and reduced chirp.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this can be resolved by considering more carefully the generation of additional frequency components by the Kerr nonlinearity.
The essential point is to realize that the Kerr nonlinearity adds certain complex <em>amplitudes</em> to other frequency components.
(The typically used differential equations for light propagation in fibers clearly show that.)
How the <em>intensities</em> of these frequency components change, depends on the relative signs of existing and added complex amplitudes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the pulse is unchirped (i.e., it has a constant <a href="instantaneous_frequency.html" title="instantaneous frequency: temporal derivative of the oscillation phase divided by 2&pi;">instantaneous frequency</a>), the complex amplitudes added in the frequency domain are 90&deg; out of phase with the already existing frequency components.
As a result, the magnitude of these frequency components does not change to first order.
This explains, for example, how a fundamental soliton pulse can have a constant optical bandwidth: the chirp introduced by the nonlinearity is constantly removed by the (anomalous) chromatic dispersion, and unchirped pulses are effectively <em>not</em> broadened by SPM.</li>
<li>Without chromatic dispersion, the situation is different: the pulse can acquire a growing chirp, and here the magnitude of the generated frequency components can indeed grow, so that the bandwidth increases.</li>
<li>If, however, a pulse initially has a down-chirp, the outer frequency components are indeed reduced by SPM, because the added amplitudes are out of phase with the existing ones.
In that situation, SPM leads to spectral compression rather than broadening.</li>
</ul>
<p>We see that the sign of the chirp of the pulse is essential for the nonlinear effects on the pulse spectrum, as is also illustrated in the following two diagrams:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/spm_and_bandwidth1.png" alt="SPM on up-chirped pulse">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
Evolution of the spectrum of an initially up-chirped pulse under the influence of SPM. (Subsequent spectra are more and more vertically displaced.) The pulse spectrum is increasingly broadened.
</figcaption>
<img src="img/spm_and_bandwidth2.png" alt="SPM on down-chirped pulse">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;2:</span> 
Evolution of the spectrum of an initially down-chirped pulse under the influence of SPM. The pulse spectrum is initially compressed.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is also instructive to consider a <a href="soliton_mode_locking.html" title="soliton mode locking: a mechanism for laser mode locking based on soliton pulses">soliton mode-locked</a> laser where the pulse bandwidth is constantly reduced by the finite gain bandwidth (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="gain_narrowing.html" title="gain narrowing: the phenomenon that the bandwidth of light can be reduced during amplification in a medium with a limited gain bandwidth"><em>gain narrowing</em></a>). 
In the steady state of the laser, there must be an effect to compensate for this.
Apart from a modulator or a saturable absorber, SPM can take over that function.
The pulse then must develop a positive chirp, as spectral broadening is possible only with that.
Indeed one can observe in computer simulations that pulses in soliton mode-locked lasers exhibit a slight up-chirp, depending on the magnitude of bandwidth-reducing effects.</p>
<p>The presented thoughts demonstrate that one can learn a lot by thinking about basic effects e.g. in <a href="ultrafast_optics.html" title="ultrafast optics: the part of optics dealing with ultrafast phenomena">ultrafast optics</a> or <a href="laser_physics.html" title="laser physics: the field of physics dealing with phenomena in lasers">laser physics</a> a little more closely.
Many people are too quickly satisfied with inaccurate descriptions of effects, which are in contradiction even with quite common observations.</p>
<p>The probably most effective way for detecting and subsequently revising inaccurate beliefs is to deal with numerical models.
Here, existing beliefs are continuously put to test.
Seeing quite easily what exactly goes on in various systems (e.g., in a <a href="transparent_laser.html"><em>transparent laser</em></a> realized in the form of a computer model), one quite quickly realizes that certain thoughts cannot be correct.
At the same time, this is one of the greatest opportunities to obtain new ideas.</p>

<h2>The Transparent Laser</h2>
<p>The dream of each laser developer, and not only of each laser scientist: have a <b>transparent laser</b>, where you can <b>look into any components</b> and see e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>optical intensities</li>
<li>excitation densities of laser-active ions</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and this at any location and time, with arbitrary resolution!</p>
<p>If you had this, finally you could</p>
<ul>
<li>fully understand what goes on in your laser,</li>
<li>quickly identify and fix any problems, and</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#B20B28;">make faster progress <br> while saving a lot of money.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely marvelous, but only a dream?!?</p>
<p>Good news: such transparent lasers can be made!
