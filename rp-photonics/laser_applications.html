<p><a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">Lasers</a> are sources of light with very special properties, as discussed in the article on <a href="laser_light.html" title="laser light: light generated with a laser device">laser light</a>.
For that reason, there is a great variety of laser applications, leading to a total of over 8 billion USD of global laser sales (as of 2013).
The following sections give a brief overview.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Manufacturing</h2>
<div>
<p>Lasers are widely used in manufacturing, e.g. for cutting, drilling, welding, cladding, soldering (brazing), hardening, ablating, surface treatment, <a href="laser_marking.html" title="laser marking: a group of methods for labeling materials with lasers">marking</a>, engraving, micromachining, <a href="pulsed_laser_deposition.html" title="pulsed laser deposition: a method for fabricating thin films on substrates by evaporating materials with laser pulses">pulsed laser deposition</a>, lithography, alignment, etc.
In most cases, relatively high <a href="optical_intensity.html" title="optical intensity: optical power per unit area">optical intensities</a> are applied to a small spot, leading to intense heating, possibly evaporation and plasma generation.
Essential aspects are the high spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="coherence: a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> of laser light, allowing for strong focusing, and often also the potential for <a href="pulse_generation.html" title="pulse generation: the generation of light pulses (flashes)">generating</a> intense <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a>.</p>
<p>Laser processing methods have many advantages, compared with mechanical approaches.
They allow the fabrication of very fine structures with high quality, avoiding mechanical stress such as caused by mechanical drills and blades.
A <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beam</a> with high beam quality can be used to drill very fine and deep holes, e.g. for injection nozzles.
A high processing speed is often achieved, e.g. in the fabrication of filter sieves.
Further, the lifetime limitation of mechanical tools is removed.
It can also be advantageous to process materials without touching them.</p>
<p>The requirements on <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> and <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> depend very much on the application and the involved materials.
For example, <a href="laser_marking.html" title="laser marking: a group of methods for labeling materials with lasers">laser marking</a> on plastics can be done with fairly low power levels, whereas cutting, welding or drilling on metals requires much more &ndash; often multiple kilowatts.
Soldering applications may require a high power but only a moderate beam quality, whereas particularly remote welding (i.e., welding with a substantial distance between laser head and welded parts) depends on a high beam quality.</p>
<p>Laser-aided manufacturing often allows one to produce the essentially same parts with higher quality and/or lower cost.
Also, it is often possible to realize entirely new part designs or the use of new materials.
For example, automobile parts are increasingly made of light materials such as aluminum, which require tentatively more laser joining operations.
Weight reductions are possible not only by the user of lighter materials, but also e.g. by producing them with shorter flanges due to higher precision than is feasible with conventional production methods.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Medical Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>There is a wide range of medical applications.
Often these relate to the outer parts of the human body, which are easily reached with light; examples are eye surgery and vision correction (LASIK), dentistry, dermatology (e.g. photodynamic therapy of cancer), and various kinds of cosmetic treatment such as tattoo removal and hair removal.</p>
<p>Lasers are also used for surgery (e.g. of the prostate), exploiting the possibility to cut tissues while causing minimal bleeding.
Some operations can be done with endoscopic means; an endoscope may contain an optical <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a> for delivering light light to the operation scene and another fiber for imaging, apart from additional channels for mechanical instruments.</p>
<p>Very different types of lasers are required for medical applications, depending on the optical wavelength, output power, pulse format, etc.
In many cases, the laser wavelength is chosen such that certain substances (e.g. pigments in tattoos or caries in teeth) absorb light more strongly than surrounding tissue, so that they can be more precisely targeted.</p>
<p>Medical lasers are not always used for therapy.
Some of them rather assist the diagnosis, e.g. via methods of ocular imaging, laser microscopy or <a href="spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy: methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized">spectroscopy</a> (see below).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Metrology</h2>
<div>
<p>Lasers are widely used in <a href="optical_metrology.html" title="optical metrology: the science and technology of performing measurements with light">optical metrology</a>, e.g. for extremely precise position measurements and optical surface profiling with <a href="interferometers.html" title="interferometers: optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference">interferometers</a>, for long-distance <a href="distance_measurements_with_lasers.html" title="distance measurements with lasers: measurements of distances using laser light">range finding</a> and navigation.</p>
<p>Laser scanners are based on <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="collimated beams: laser beams with weak divergence">collimated</a> <a href="laser_beams.html" title="laser beams: light beams propagating dominantly in one direction">laser beams</a>, which can read e.g. bar codes or other graphics over some distance.
It is also possible to scan three-dimensional objects, e.g. in the context of crime scene investigation (CSI).</p>
<p><a href="optical_sampling.html" title="optical sampling: a technique of sampling signals using laser light, often in the form of ultrashort pulses">Optical sampling</a> is a technique applied for the characterization of fast electronic microcircuits, microwave photonics, <a href="terahertz_radiation.html" title="terahertz radiation: electromagnetic radiation with terahertz frequencies">terahertz</a> science, etc.</p>
<p>Lasers also allow for extremely precise time measurements and are therefore essential component of <a href="optical_clocks.html" title="optical clocks: time measurement devices based on optical frequency standards">optical clocks</a> which are beginning to outperform the currently used cesium atomic clocks.</p>
<p><a href="fiber_optic_sensors.html" title="fiber-optic sensors: optical sensors based on fiber devices">Fiber-optic sensors</a>, often probed with laser light, allow for the distributed measurement of temperature, stress, and other quantities e.g. in oil pipelines and wings of airplanes.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Data Storage</h2>
<div>
<p>Optical data storage e.g. in compact disks (CDs), DVDs, Blu-ray Discs and magneto-optical disks, nearly always relies on a laser source, which has a high spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="coherence: a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> and can thus be used to address very tiny spots in the recording medium, allowing a very high density data storage.
Another case is holography, where the temporal coherence can also be important.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Communications</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">Optical fiber communication</a>, extensively used particularly for long-distance <a href="optical_data_transmission.html" title="optical data transmission: the transmission of information using light beams, e.g. in fibers">optical data transmission</a>, mostly relies on laser light in optical glass <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a>.
<a href="free_space_optical_communications.html" title="free-space optical communications: optical data transmission through free space, usually through air or vacuum">Free-space optical communications</a>, e.g. for inter-satellite communications, is based on higher-power lasers, generating <a href="collimated_beams.html" title="collimated beams: laser beams with weak divergence">collimated laser beams</a> which propagate over large distances with small <a href="beam_divergence.html" title="beam divergence: a measure for how fast a laser beam expands far from its focus">beam divergence</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Displays</h2>
<div>
<p>Laser projection displays containing <a href="rgb_sources.html" title="RGB sources: source of red, green and blue light, which is usually provided in the form laser beams">RGB sources</a> can be used for cinemas, home videos, flight simulators, etc., and are often superior to other displays concerning possible screen dimensions, resolution and color saturation.
However, further reductions in manufacturing costs will be essential for deep market penetration.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Spectroscopy</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="spectroscopy.html" title="spectroscopy: methods where the interaction of light with matter is utilized">Laser spectroscopy</a> is used in many different forms and in a wide range of applications.
For example, atmospheric physics and pollution monitoring profits from trace gas sensing with differential absorption LIDAR technology.
Solid materials can be analyzed with <a href="laser_induced_breakdown.html" title="laser-induced breakdown: a kind of spark, initiated by intense laser light">laser-induced breakdown</a> spectroscopy.
Laser spectroscopy also plays a role in medicine (e.g. cancer detection), biology, and various types of fundamental research, partly related to metrology (see above).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Microscopy</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="laser_microscopy.html" title="laser microscopy: a technique for generating microscopic images by scanning objects with a laser">Laser microscopes</a> and setups for <a href="optical_coherence_tomography.html" title="optical coherence tomography: an optical imaging technique where longitudinal resolution is achieved based on interference effects with low-coherence light">optical coherence tomography</a> (OCT) provide images of, e.g., biological samples with very high resolution, often in three dimensions.
It is also possible to realize functional imaging.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Various Scientific Applications</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="laser_cooling.html" title="laser cooling: a variety of techniques for reducing the temperature (i.e., the random motion) of small particles such as atoms or ions">Laser cooling</a> makes it possible to bring clouds of atoms or ions to extremely low temperatures.
This has applications in fundamental research and also for industrial purposes.</p>
<p>Particularly in biological and medical research, <a href="optical_tweezers.html" title="optical tweezers: arrangements for capturing and moving particles with laser beams">optical tweezers</a> can be used for trapping and manipulating small particles, such as bacteria or parts of living cells.</p>
<p><a href="laser_guide_stars.html" title="laser guide stars: small bright spots in the sky, generated with laser beams for use in astronomy with adaptive optics imaging">Laser guide stars</a> are used in astronomical observatories in combination with adaptive optics for atmospheric correction.
They allow substantially increased image resolution even in cases where a sufficiently close-by natural guide star is not available.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Energy Technology</h2>
<div>
<p>In the future, <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="high-power lasers: lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power laser</a> systems might play a role in electricity generation.
Laser-induced nuclear fusion is investigated as a alternative to other types of fusion reactors.
High-power lasers can also be used for isotope separation.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Military Applications</h2>
<div>
<p>There are a variety of military laser applications.
In relatively few cases, lasers are used as weapons; the &ldquo;laser sword&rdquo; has become popular in movies, but not in practice.
Some <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="high-power lasers: lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power lasers</a> are currently developed for potential use as <em>directed energy weapons</em> on the battle field, or for destroying missiles, projectiles and mines.</p>
<p>In other cases, lasers function as target designators or laser sights (essentially <a href="laser_pointers.html" title="laser pointers: devices used for pointing at items with laser beams">laser pointers</a> emitting visible or invisible laser beams), or as irritating or blinding (normally not directly destroying) countermeasures e.g. against heat-seeking anti-aircraft missiles.
It is also possible to blind soldiers temporarily or permanently with laser beams, although the latter is forbidden by rules of war.</p>
<p>There are also many laser applications which are not specific for military use, e.g. in areas such as <a href="distance_measurements_with_lasers.html" title="distance measurements with lasers: measurements of distances using laser light">range finding</a>, LIDAR, and optical communications.</p>

<li>What is a <a href="tutorial_modeling12a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">model</a>?</li>
<li>Should one use <a href="tutorial_modeling32a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">power propagation or field propagation</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate the behavior of <a href="tutorial_modeling42a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">laser-active ions</a>?</li>
<li>How to calculate <a href="tutorial_modeling52a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">steady-state solutions</a>?</li>
<li>How to simulate <a href="tutorial_modeling62a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">dynamical behavior</a> and <a href="tutorial_modeling72a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">ultrashort pulse propagation</a>?</li>
<li>What aspects are important for the <a href="tutorial_modeling82a20.html?banner=modeling_tutorial">decision</a> whether to develop own modeling software or use commercial software?</li>
