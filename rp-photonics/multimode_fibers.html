<p>Multimode fibers are optical <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fibers</a> which support multiple (often many) transverse guided <a href="modes.html" title="modes: self-consistent electric field distributions in waveguides, optical resonators or in free space">modes</a> for a given optical frequency and polarization.</p>
<p>The number of guided modes is determined by the wavelength and the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> profile.
For <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="step-index fibers: optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index fibers</a>, the relevant quantities are the core radius and the <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>; the latter depends on the <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> contrast between <a href="fiber_core.html" title="fiber core: the region in an optical fiber which guides light">fiber core</a> and cladding.
In combination, these quantities determine the <a href="v_number.html" title="V number: a normalized frequency parameter, which determines the number of modes of a step-index fiber"><i>V</i> number</a> of <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="step-index fibers: optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index fibers</a>.
For large <span class="eqn_il"><i>V</i></span> values, the number of modes is roughly <span class="eqn_il"><i>V</i><sup>2</sup>&thinsp;/&thinsp;2</span>, when counting both polarization directions.
Particularly for fibers with a relatively large core (right-hand side in Figure&nbsp;1), the number of supported modes can be very high.</p>
<p>Highly multimode fibers can guide light with poor <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and high <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> (e.g. generated with a high-power <a href="diode_bars.html" title="diode bars: a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bar</a>), but for preserving the beam quality of a light source with higher <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> it can be better to use a fiber with smaller core and moderate <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>, even though efficient launching of light into the fiber may then be more difficult.</p>
<figure class="right" style="width:245px;">
<img src="img/fiber_core.png" alt="core of single-mode and multimode fiber">
<figcaption><span class="start">Figure&nbsp;1:</span> 
A single-mode fiber (left) has a core which is very small compared with the cladding, whereas a multimode fiber (right) can have a large core.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Compared with standard <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a>, multimode fibers usually have significantly larger core areas, but also generally a higher <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> of e.g. 0.2&ndash;0.3.
The latter leads to robust guidance, even under conditions of tight bending, but also to higher propagation losses without bending, as irregularities at the core&ndash;cladding interface can scatter light more effectively.
The <a href="refractive_index.html" title="refractive index: a measure of the reduction in the velocity of light in a medium">refractive index</a> profile is usually rectangular (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="step-index fibers: optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile"><em>step-index fibers</em></a>), but sometimes parabolic (see below).</p>
<p>A basic specification of a multimode fiber contains the core diameter and the outer diameter of a multimode fiber.
Common types for fiber-optic communications (see below) are 50/125&nbsp;&mu;m and 62.5/125&nbsp;&mu;m fibers, having a core diameter of 50&nbsp;&mu;m or 62.5&nbsp;&mu;m, respectively, and a cladding diameter of 125&nbsp;&mu;m.
Such fibers support hundreds of guided modes.
There are also <a href="large_core_fibers.html" title="large-core fibers: optical fibers with relatively large fiber core">large-core fibers</a> with even substantially larger core diameters of hundreds of micrometers.</p>
<p>Launching light into a multimode fiber is comparatively easy, because there are larger tolerances concerning the location and propagation angle of incident light, compared with a single-mode fiber.
On the other hand, the spatial <a href="coherence.html" title="coherence: a fixed phase relationship between the electric field values at different locations or at different times">coherence</a> of the fiber output is reduced, and the output field pattern can hardly be controlled, for reasons explained below.</p>
<figure>

Electric field amplitude profiles for all the guided modes of an optical <a href="fibers.html" title="fibers: a kind of long and thin optical waveguides which can be bent to some degree">fiber</a>.
In general, light launched into a multimode fiber will excite a superposition of different modes.
The diagram has been produced with the <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b> software</a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure&nbsp;2 shows the electric field profiles of the guided modes of a <a href="step_index_fibers.html" title="step-index fibers: optical fibers with a step-index refractive index profile">step-index fiber</a>, as calculated for one particular wavelength.
There is a fundamental mode (<a href="lp_modes.html" title="LP modes: linearly polarized modes of optical fibers with radially symmetric index profiles in the approximation of weak guidance">LP<sub>01</sub></a>) with an approximately Gaussian intensity distribution, and a number of higher-order modes with more complicated spatial profiles.
Each mode has a different <span class="eqn_il"><span class="greek">&beta;</span></span> value.
Any guided field distribution can be considered as a superposition of the guided modes.</p>
<p>The total electric field distribution anywhere in a multimode fiber is a superposition of contributions from the different modes.
The intensity profile depends not only on the <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical powers</a> in all the modes, but also on the relative phases, and there can be constructive or destructive <a href="interference.html" title="interference: a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> of different modes at particular locations in the fiber.
Both the <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">powers</a> and <a href="optical_phase.html" title="optical phase: the phase of the electric field of an optical wave, usually considered in the time domain">optical phases</a> are initially determined by the launching conditions, and the relative phases (and thus the <a href="interference.html" title="interference: a range of phenomena associated with the superposition of waves">interference</a> conditions) evolve further due to the mode-dependent <a href="propagation_constant.html" title="propagation constant: a mode- and frequency-dependent quantity describing the propagation of light in a medium or waveguide">propagation constants</a>.
Therefore, the more or less complicated intensity pattern changes all the time, typically with significant changes occurring within a propagation length of well below 1&nbsp;mm.
Also, the relative phases changes with any modifications of the launching conditions, bending or stretching of the fiber, changes of the wavelength or temperature, etc.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;3 shows an example in the form of animated graphics, where the different frames represent intensity distributions occurring at the end of a multimode fiber when the input beam position is varied.</p>
<figure>

Intensity profiles at the end of a multimode fiber.
The Gaussian input beam is scanned through the horizontal line (slightly above the center of the fiber core).
This model has been made with the <a href="fiberpower.html"><b>RP Fiber Power</b> software</a> and is described in more detail on a <a href="fiberpower_launch.html">separate page</a>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that for light with a broad optical <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> (e.g. for a <a href="white_light_sources.html" title="white light sources: light sources with very broad optical bandwidth">white light source</a>) such complicated intensity patterns are not observed, if only the intensity is detected without distinguishing different spectral components.
This is because the shape of the intensity pattern is different for each wavelength component, so that contributions from different wavelengths are averaged out.
The longer the fiber, the lower is the optical bandwidth required to achieve this averaging.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Required Beam Quality for Launching Light into a Multimode Fiber</h2>
<div>
<p>Compared with a single-mode fiber, a multimode fiber allows for much easier launching of light, particularly if it supports many guided modes.
For efficient launching, one has to fulfill two conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="ta_left">The input light should essentially only hit the core, not the cladding.</li>
<li class="ta_left">The input light should not contain significant amounts of power propagating with angles larger than arcsin NA.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <a href="m2_factor.html" title="<i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor: a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a> of the input light is sufficiently small, it is possible to fulfill these two conditions simultaneously.
The maximum <a href="m2_factor.html" title="<i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor: a parameter for quantifying the beam quality of laser beams"><i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor</a> for efficient launching of a beam with super-Gaussian profile can be estimated from the following formula:</p>
<div class="eqn"><img src="eqn/m2_max_mm.gif" width="144" height="26" alt="maximum M2 for launching into a multimode fiber"></div>
<p>This holds if both the spatial beam profile and the angular distribution (i.e., the profile in Fourier space) are well adapted for launching, with a kind of super-Gaussian shape.
For Gaussian distributions, the <i>M</i><sup>2</sup> factor needs to be somewhat lower.
For more details and example cases, see Ref. [6].</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Multimode Fibers for Transporting Laser Light</h2>
<div>
<p>Multimode fibers are used for the transport of light from a laser source to the place where it is needed, particularly when the light source has a poor <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and/or the high <a href="optical_power.html" title="optical power: the energy per unit time, e.g. transported by a laser beam, or a focusing power">optical power</a> requires a large area of the fiber core.
For example, light from stationary <a href="high_power_lasers.html" title="high-power lasers: lasers emitting very high optical powers">high-power lasers</a> of various types can be sent to material processing stations for cutting or welding, where e.g. a robot moves a laser head mounted at the end of a fiber cable.
Also, <a href="fiber_coupled_diode_lasers.html" title="fiber-coupled diode lasers: diode laser devices where the generated light is coupled into an optical fiber">fiber-coupled</a> high-power <a href="diode_bars.html" title="diode bars: a type of semiconductor laser containing a one-dimensional array of broad-area emitters">diode bars</a> and <a href="diode_stacks.html" title="diode stacks: arrangements of multiple diode bars, delivering very high output power">diode stacks</a> use multimode fibers, as their beam quality is far from <a href="diffraction_limited_beams.html" title="diffraction-limited beams: beams with a minimum possible beam divergence for a given waist radius">diffraction-limited</a>.
Fiber coupling is useful because it allows one e.g. to separate the pump diodes and their cooling arrangement from the <a href="laser_heads.html" title="laser heads: assemblies containing a mounted gain medium and means for pumping and cooling, or the complete optical parts of a laser, or assemblies for directing a laser beam to a workpiece">laser head</a> of a <a href="diode_pumped_lasers.html" title="diode-pumped lasers: solid-state lasers which are pumped with laser diodes">diode-pumped</a> <a href="solid_state_lasers.html" title="solid-state lasers: lasers based on solid-state gain media (usually ion-doped crystals or glasses)">solid-state laser</a>.
However, fiber-coupled laser diodes are more expensive, and depending on the <a href="beam_shapers.html" title="beam shapers: optical devices for modifying the shapes of laser beams">beam shapers</a> used, there can be some significant loss of <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a>.</p>
<p>For such applications, the number of guided modes should often not be larger than necessary for efficient launching, since otherwise the laser radiation might be distributed over a large than necessary number of modes, and the <a href="beam_quality.html" title="beam quality: a measure for how well a laser beam can be focused">beam quality</a> and <a href="brightness.html" title="brightness: a term mostly used in a qualitative way, related to the output power and beam quality of a laser; quantitatively: synonymous with radiance or luminance">brightness</a> would be reduced.</p>
<p>In practice, a simple step-index refractive profile is normally used.
The <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a> is often held constant at some standard value such as 0.22, and the core diameter is chosen according to the beam quality of the light source.
Common values for the core diameter are 50, 100, 200, 400, 600 and 800&nbsp;&mu;m.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Multimode Fibers for Optical Communications</h2>
<div>
<p>For short-distance <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>, multimode fibers are often preferred over <a href="single_mode_fibers.html" title="single-mode fibers: optical fibers supporting only a single guided mode per polarization direction">single-mode fibers</a>, because they can accept light from simpler light sources (e.g. <a href="light_emitting_diodes.html" title="light-emitting diodes: semiconductor diodes that emit light via electroluminescence">light-emitting diodes</a> = LEDs), and their alignment (e.g. in <a href="fiber_connectors.html" title="fiber connectors: connectors used as terminations of optical fiber cables">fiber connectors</a>) is less critical.
However, the possible data rates and/or transmission distances achievable with such fibers is limited by the phenomenon of <a href="intermodal_dispersion.html" title="intermodal dispersion: the phenomenon that the group velocity of light propagating in a waveguide structure depends on the waveguide mode">intermodal dispersion</a>: the <a href="group_velocity.html" title="group velocity: the velocity with which the envelope of a weak narrow-band optical pulse propagates in a medium">group velocity</a> depends on the propagation mode, so that <a href="ultrashort_pulses.html" title="ultrashort pulses: optical pulses with durations of picoseconds or less">ultrashort pulses</a> propagating in a multimode fiber may be split into several <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a> with different arrival times, possibly smearing out any transmitted signal.
This effect can be greatly reduced by making multimode fibers with a parabolic refractive index profile (<a href="graded_index_fibers.html" title="graded-index fibers: optical fibers with a continuously varying refractive index in the radial dimension"><em>graded-index fibers</em></a>, Figure&nbsp;4), so that a substantially larger <a href="bandwidth_distance_product.html" title="bandwidth&ndash;distance product: product of length and maximum signal bandwidth of a fiber-optic link">bandwidth&ndash;distance product</a> can be achieved.
However, unavoidable imperfections still set limits.
There are ISO standards like OM1, OM2, OM3 and OM4, which quantify the residual level of intermodal dispersion, limiting the transmission bandwidth (or the <a href="bandwidth_distance_product.html" title="bandwidth&ndash;distance product: product of length and maximum signal bandwidth of a fiber-optic link">bandwidth&ndash;distance product</a>).
The highest performance is achieved with OM4 50/125-&mu;m laser-optimized fibers, having a very precisely controlled refractive index profile.
The data transmitter then normally contains an 850-nm <a href="vertical_cavity_surface_emitting_lasers.html" title="vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers: a monolithic kind of semiconductor lasers with beam emission perpendicular to the wafer surface">VCSEL</a>.</p>

<p>For long-haul data transmission, single-mode fibers are preferable, as they do not exhibit any intermodal dispersion, whereas the system cost is substantially higher.</p>
<p>The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has developed a number of standards for various types of fibers as used for <a href="optical_fiber_communications.html" title="optical fiber communications: the technology of transmitting information through optical fibers">optical fiber communications</a>.

<h2 class="togglediv">Active Multimode Fibers</h2>
<div>
<p>Some high-power <a href="fiber_amplifiers.html" title="fiber amplifiers: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media">fiber amplifiers</a> are based on multimode fibers, because these can have larger mode areas (&rarr;&nbsp;<a href="large_mode_area_fibers.html" title="large mode area fibers: optical fibers with relatively large mode areas and a single transverse mode or only a few modes"><em>large mode area fibers</em></a>).
Such fibers have only a few guided modes, i.e., they still have a relatively small core compared to most other multimode fibers.
It is often possible to obtain a nearly diffraction-limited output by launching the input signal light into the fundamental mode and by minimizing mode mixing.</p>

The most common multimode glass fibers are <a href="silica_fibers.html" title="silica fibers: optical fibers based on fused silica or related materials">silica fibers</a>, where a pure silica core is surrounded by a region which is doped with some index-lowering agent (e.g. fluorine).
Alternatively or in addition, the core can have some additional doping, e.g. with germania, to increase the refractive index.
Particularly for <a href="large_core_fibers.html" title="large-core fibers: optical fibers with relatively large fiber core">large-core fibers</a>, the plasma outside deposition (POD) method allows the efficient fabrication of fluorine-doped &ldquo;depressed index claddings&rdquo; around a pure silica core.</p>
<p>There are also other glasses, e.g. <a href="fluoride_fibers.html" title="fluoride fibers: optical fibers based on fluoride glasses">fluoride</a> and chalcogenide glasses for guiding light with longer wavelengths, and polymers (<em>polymer optical fiber</em>, POF).
Such materials require adapted fabrication techniques.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to use <a href="photonic_crystal_fibers.html" title="photonic crystal fibers: specialty optical fibers with a built-in microstructure, in most cases consisting of small air holes in glass">photonic crystal fibers</a> (PCF), which can be made from different glasses and can have, e.g., an air cladding to achieve a very high <a href="numerical_aperture.html" title="numerical aperture: sine of the maximum angle of an incident beam of some optical device, or the sine of the acceptance angle of a waveguide or fiber">numerical aperture</a>.</p>
