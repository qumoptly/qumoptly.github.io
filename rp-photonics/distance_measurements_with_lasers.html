<p><a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">Lasers</a> can be used in various ways to measure distances or displacements without physical contact.
In fact they allow for the most sensitive and precise length measurements, for extremely fast recordings (sometimes with a <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> of many megahertz), and for the largest measurement ranges, even though these qualities are usually not combined by a single technique.
Depending on the specific demands, very different technical approaches can be appropriate.
They find a wide range of applications, for example in architecture, inspection of fabrication halls, criminal scene investigation (CSI), and in the military.</p>
<h2 class="togglediv">Techniques for Distance Measurements</h2>
<div>
<p>Some of the most important techniques used for laser distance meters are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="triangulation.html" title="triangulation: a method for distance measurements"><em>Triangulation</em></a> is a geometric method, useful for distances in the range of &asymp;&thinsp;1&nbsp;mm to many kilometers.</li>
<li><a href="time_of_flight_measurements.html" title="time-of-flight measurements: distance measurements based on measuring the time of flight of a light pulse"><em>Time-of-flight measurements</em></a> (or <em>pulse measurements</em>) are based on measuring the time of flight of a laser pulse from the measurement device to some target and back again.
Such laser radar methods (see below) are typically used for large distances such as hundreds of meters or many kilometers.
Using advanced techniques, it is possible to measure the distance between Earth and the Moon with an accuracy of a few centimeters.
Typical accuracies of simple devices for short distances are a few millimeters or centimeters.</li>
<li>The <a href="phase_shift_method_for_distance_measurements.html" title="phase shift method for distance measurements: a method for optical distance measurements"><em>phase shift method</em></a> uses an intensity-modulated laser beam.
One measures the phase shift of an intensity modulation which is related to the time of flight.
Compared with interferometric techniques, its accuracy is lower, but it allows unambiguous measurements over larger distances and is more suitable for targets with diffuse reflection. <br />
Note that the phase shift technique is sometimes also called a <em>time-of-flight technique</em>, as the phase shift is proportional to the time of flight, but the term is more suitable for methods as described above where the time of flight of a light pulse is measured.</li>
<li>For small distances, one sometimes uses <em>ultrasonic time-of-flight methods</em>, and the device may contain a <a href="laser_pointers.html" title="laser pointers: devices used for pointing at items with laser beams">laser pointer</a> just for getting the right direction, but not for the distance measurement itself.</li>
<li><em>Frequency modulation methods</em> involve frequency-modulated laser beams, for example with a repetitive linear frequency ramp.
The distance to be measured can be translated into a frequency offset, which may be measured via a <a href="beat_note.html" title="beat note: an oscillation of the optical intensity arising from the superposition of light with different optical frequencies">beat note</a> of the sent-out and received beam.</li>
<li><a href="interferometers.html" title="interferometers: optical devices utilizing the phenomenon of interference"><em>Interferometers</em></a> allow for distance measurements with an accuracy which is far better than the wavelength of the light used.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Laser Radar</h2>
<div>
<p>A laser radar (more precisely: LIDAR = light detection and ranging) is a device which uses one of the distance measurement techniques as described above &ndash; usually the time-of-flight method or the phase-shift method &ndash;, and scans the direction of the distance measurement in one or typically two dimensions.
That allows the acquisition of an image, or more precisely a depth profile of some object, as required e.g. in robotics or for self-driving cars.
For acquiring such depth profiles at a higher rate, there are sensor chips similar to CCDs (charge-coupled devices) with internal electronics to detect phase shifts, so that the distance for each pixel can be measured simultaneously.
Similarly, there are sensor chips containing an array of <a href="avalanche_photodiodes.html" title="avalanche photodiodes: photodiodes with internal signal amplification through an avalanche process">avalanche photodiodes</a> for the application of the time-of-flight method with single-photon detection.
Such compact devices can greatly facilitate the development of laser radars with rapid three-dimensional imaging.</p>
<p>Compared with ultrasonic or radio and microwave frequency devices (radar), the main advantage of laser distance measurement techniques is that <a href="laser_light.html" title="laser light: light generated with a laser device">laser light</a> has a much smaller wavelength, allowing one to send out a much more concentrated probe beam and thus to achieve a higher transverse spatial resolution.
Another advantage that an optical bandpass <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">filter</a> makes it possible to very effectively remove noise influences at other optical frequencies.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Laser Safety Aspects</h2>
<div>
<p>Range finding with lasers can raise serious <a href="laser_safety.html" title="laser safety: safety of the use of laser devices">laser safety</a> issues, particularly when intense <a href="pulses.html" title="pulses: flashes of light">pulses</a> from <a href="q_switched_lasers.html" title="Q-switched lasers: lasers which emit optical pulses, relying on the method of Q switching">Q-switched lasers</a> are used; that is often required for large detection distances in order not only to obtain a detectable amount of returned light, but also to avoid a dominating influence of ambient light.
Then, however, inconvenient additional measures may have to be taken to ensure safety, particularly for human eyes.</p>
<p>Frequently, one tries to design devices to operate a laser safety class I, so that special additional laser safety measures are not required.
That, however, can severely limit the optical power which can be sent to the target, and therefore the detection capabilities.</p>
<p>Such trade-offs can be mitigated by applying <a href="eye_safe_lasers.html" title="eye-safe lasers: lasers emitting in a wavelength region with relatively low hazards for the human eye">eye-safe lasers</a>, e.g. in the 1.5-&mu;m spectral region, where far more optical power can be safely used than e.g. in the 1-&mu;m region.
However, both the choice of lasers and <a href="photodetectors.html" title="photodetectors: devices used for the detection of light">photodetectors</a> (and their performance) are then substantially limited, and the system cost may be significantly higher.</p>
<p>There are also other ways to improve the trade-off between hazards and detection capabilities, e.g. using improved methods to suppress influences of disturbing ambient light.
For example, a photodetector may be used in conjunction with a bandpass filter having a small transmission <a href="bandwidth.html" title="bandwidth: the width of some frequency or wavelength range">bandwidth</a> around the laser wavelength, so that most ambient light is strongly suppressed.
Further, one can optimize the temporal structure of the used light as well as the sensitivity of the detection apparatus.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="togglediv">Various Issues</h2>
<div>
<p>As essentially all other measurement techniques using lasers, laser distance measurements can be affected by <a href="laser_noise.html" title="laser noise: fluctuations of various parameters of laser light, such as the optical power and phase">laser noise</a> &ndash; although detection noise is usually the dominant issue.
Other noise-related issues can arise from stray light and <a href="speckle.html" title="speckle: light patterns resulting from the reflection of coherent light at rough surfaces">speckle</a> effects.</p>
<p>The targets can have very different reflection and scattering properties.
Problems can arise for very low reflection or for specular reflections.
In the latter case, a lot of the incident light may be reflected in directions which are not useful for the detection.</p>
