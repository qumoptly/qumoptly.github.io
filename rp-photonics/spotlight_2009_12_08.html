<p class="ref">Ref.: encyclopedia articles on <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">wavelength tuning</a></p>
<p>By using an intracavity bandpass <a href="optical_filters.html" title="optical filters: devices with a wavelength-dependent transmission or reflectivity">filter</a> with adjustable transmission wavelength, we can <a href="wavelength_tuning.html" title="wavelength tuning: the manipulation of the output wavelength of an optical device such as a laser or an optical parametric oscillator">tune the emission wavelength</a> of a <a href="lasers.html" title="lasers: devices generating visible or invisible light, based on stimulated emission of light">laser</a>.
One would normally expect that the highest output power is obtained when one allows the laser to operate at the wavelength which it would choose itself when no filter is present.
Curiously, this is not always true.</p>
<p>But let's first ask why we would actually expect the above statement to be true.
It is probably because the laser will then operate at the wavelength of highest net <a href="gain.html" title="gain: a measure of the strength of optical amplification">gain</a>.
But why exactly should this lead to the highest efficiency?
Surely, it would mean that the lowest amount of excitation of the <a href="gain_media.html" title="gain media: media for laser amplification">gain medium</a> is required, and therefore the minimum possible power is lost via <a href="spontaneous_emission.html" title="spontaneous emission: a quantum effect, causing the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms or ions">spontaneous emission</a>.
However, is this enough to guarantee that the power is most efficiently extracted from the gain medium?</p>
<p>In fact, it isn't.
Imagine a situation where at the wavelength of highest gain there is also some parasitic loss, resulting from <a href="excited_state_absorption.html" title="excited-state absorption: absorption of light by ions or atoms in an excited electronic state, rather than in the electronic ground state">excited-state absorption</a>, for example.
One may then obtain a higher output power by forcing the laser to operate at some different wavelength, having a somewhat lower gain but also avoiding that loss.
This situation, of course, can occur only when there is a wavelength-dependent power loss, which is sufficiently high to be relevant but also sufficiently weak that it does not affect the laser wavelength.</p>
<p>In a somewhat similar case, we could have a very high output coupler reflectivity at some wavelength, but a very small output coupling efficiency, because parasitic losses would destroy most of the generated power.
It would again help to force the laser to operate at a wavelength where the output coupling efficiency is higher.</p>
<p>The described phenomenon can even occur in a situation where there are no parasitic losses.
Imagine that there is gain in two different wavelength regions, exhibiting a significantly different <a href="quantum_defect.html" title="quantum defect: energy difference between pump and laser photons">quantum defect</a>.
For example, we could have a <a href="neodymium_doped_gain_media.html" title="neodymium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active neodymium ions">neodymium-doped</a> <a href="laser_crystals.html" title="laser crystals: transparent crystals with laser-active dopants, used as laser gain media">laser crystal</a>, strongly pumped around 0.8&thinsp;&mu;m and having gain around 0.95&thinsp;&mu;m, 1.06&thinsp;&mu;m and also in the 1.3-&mu;m region.
If the laser resonator offers similar losses for all wavelengths, the laser will normally run at 1.06&thinsp;&mu;m, where the gain is highest.
However, with a tuner we can force the laser to operate at 0.95&thinsp;&mu;m.
As the quantum defect is then lower, it might have a higher efficiency and thus produce a higher output power.
Well, this outcome may not be typical, as usually it is harder to obtain a high efficiency in the 0.95-&mu;m region, but there are no fundamental reasons against my claim.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As another example, consider an <a href="ytterbium_doped_gain_media.html" title="ytterbium-doped gain media: laser gain media containing laser-active ytterbium ions">ytterbium-doped</a> <a href="fiber_lasers.html" title="fiber lasers: lasers with a doped fiber as gain medium, or (sometimes) just lasers where most of the laser resonator is made of fibers">fiber laser</a>.
If the output coupler reflectivity is 80&#37;, for example, the laser will tend to operate at long wavelengths around 1080&thinsp;nm, where reabsorption is weak.
(See the minimum of the gray curve in the figure above.)
By forcing the laser to operate at 1035&thinsp;nm, for example, one can obtain slightly more output power, although the average ytterbium excitation and thus the <a href="fluorescence.html" title="fluorescence: luminescence arising from irradiation with light">fluorescence</a> power is then significantly higher.
Overall, the fluorescence power isn't that important here, as the laser gain is strongly <a href="gain_saturation.html" title="gain saturation: the phenomenon that the gain of an amplifier is reduced for high input signal powers">saturated</a>.</p>
<p>So we see that for various reasons a free-running laser may operate on a wavelength which does not produce the highest possible output power, and enforcing a different wavelength increases the output power.</p>

<h2>Fighting Fraud in Science</h2>
<p>We occasionally read about scientific fraud &ndash; things like fabricated measurement results &ndash; which is utterly unfair and also undermines the trust of the public in science and its results.</p>
<p>How to fight that problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to tell young scientists more clearly that fraud is evil?</li>
<li>Do supervisors have to stop trusting the results of their coworkers?</li>
<li>Does the pressure to produce results inevitably favor fraud?</li>
<li>Where exactly lies the responsibility, if something goes wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="spotlight_2009_10_1930d7.html?banner=science_fraud">Photonics Spotlight article on science fraud</a> analyzes that carefully.
It suggests that <b>the risk of fraud is close to zero where supervisors do a responsible job</b>.
Relations to a more widespread problem &ndash; <b>corrupt authorship practices</b> &ndash; are also identified.</p>
